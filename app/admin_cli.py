"""Host recovery commands: the way back in when the dashboard cannot let anyone in.

PLAN §4.6 gives the identity work one non-negotiable escape hatch. Every gate
this release adds — a tightened ``local_login_policy``, a sign-in provider that
owns the login screen, the second factor a break-glass account must always
present — protects the install right up to the moment it is the thing that
broke. When the identity provider is unreachable, or the second-factor secret
went missing with the phone that held it, the only actor left to trust is
whoever can reach the host and its database.

So these commands take the shortest path that exists: the configured database
URL, a synchronous engine of their own, one transaction. No FastAPI app, no
``init_db()`` (it takes the SQLite lifetime lock and would fight a running
server), no environment variable of their own, no network call — and
deliberately no policy or provider gate, because they are the recovery path for
the very lockout those gates exist to prevent. Every run leaves one
``break_glass_cli_used`` row at critical severity naming the command and its
target: an operator on the host is unauthenticated by construction, so the
audit trail is the whole of the accountability.

    ``--clear-two-factor`` exists because a break-glass account that holds a

    is the documented way out; the install-wide requirement is left alone, so
    an install that requires two-factor sends the account straight back to
    enrolment on its next sign-in.

    Clearing the secret is also what can take the account's *qualification*
    away, and under ``break_glass_only`` a designation that no longer qualifies
    is not admitted: the command would hand the operator a password for a form
    that refuses it. So the write is followed by the one question that matters

    no, local sign-in is re-opened in the same transaction. A recovery command
