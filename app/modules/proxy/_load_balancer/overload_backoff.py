"""Backoff and isolation for accounts upstream keeps rejecting as overloaded.

``server_is_overloaded`` is an admission rejection: upstream refuses to start
a *new* response for the account while already-admitted streams on the same
account keep flowing. Two properties follow that the generic transient error
path cannot express:

- It is account-scoped and bursty. One account can be rejected on most fresh
  admissions for an hour while its siblings are clean, and the rejection can
  take 30-90 s to arrive, so every fresh admission routed there costs the
  client that wait before failover even starts.
- It says nothing bad about the account's live sessions. Bridge reuse on the
  same account keeps succeeding, and every success zeroes
  ``RuntimeState.error_count`` -- so the generic error backoff and the drain
  tier never latch, and selection keeps feeding the rejected account.

This module keeps a replica-local sliding window of overload rejections per
account with two escalation stages:

1. **Soft backoff** (every trip): fresh (unbound) selection and fresh sticky
   bindings *deprioritize* the account for a bounded, exponentially growing
   interval. Established sticky owners are left alone, so a short burst never
   churns warm sessions.
2. **Isolation** (the configured trip level, sustained overload): the account
   is held out for a longer, operator-configured interval and established
   *soft* sticky owners are served by a sibling as well. Only a soft sticky
   mapping is a locality hint; every request that re-enters the pinned
   account is a fresh upstream admission, so keeping the owner pinned just
   replays the rejection wait per request. Hard continuity owners
   (``previous_response_id``, bridge ownership, file pins) are resolved
   before soft selection and are never moved by this module.

   The release is **request-local**: the sibling serves the turn while the
   sticky row keeps pointing at the owner, so the thread returns home once
   isolation lifts. Rebinding instead was measurably worse -- nothing ever
   returned a rebound thread to its owner, so each isolation episode a
   conversation touched added one more account to it permanently, and the
   observed accounts-per-conversation factor rose from ~1.02 against a quiet
   upstream to 2.29 on a healthy day and 3.45 during an incident. Because the
   turn still goes to the sibling either way, retaining the mapping costs
   nothing in availability. The substitute must be *stable* across turns for
   this to hold (see ``isolation_substitute_seed``): a per-turn
   random pick would bounce the thread across siblings and be worse than the
   single rebind.

In both stages the account is dropped from a candidate pool only while at
least one other candidate remains, so the window can never empty the pool.
The window is not reset by successes -- an account that succeeds on warm
sessions but rejects fresh admissions is exactly the case this exists for.

**Burst cooldown** (``record_upstream_burst_rejection``): a code-less upstream
HTTP 429 (a per-account burst/concurrency rejection whose body carries only a
message, no ``rate_limit_exceeded`` / usage code) is not a quota event -- the
same account typically succeeds again within seconds -- so it must neither
flip the persisted status nor touch ``cooldown_until``. It does mean the
account is momentarily saturated, so a short replica-local deadline
(``RuntimeState.burst_backoff_until``, honoring upstream ``Retry-After``
inside ``[BURST_BACKOFF_DEFAULT_SECONDS, BURST_BACKOFF_MAX_SECONDS]``) makes
``overload_backoff_active`` true and steers fresh selection and fresh sticky
bindings to a sibling. It is deliberately *not* an isolation trigger:
established soft sticky owners keep their session through a burst. The
overload rejection window and ``overload_backoff_until`` are never written by
the burst path.
