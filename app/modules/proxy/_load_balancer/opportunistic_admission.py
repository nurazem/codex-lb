"""Opportunistic admission check — private implementation unit of ``LoadBalancer``.

``LoadBalancer.check_opportunistic_admission`` delegates here. The check asks
the deterministic opportunistic selector the question a real request would
ask — same model, same ``service_tier``, same account scope, local account caps
only for the requested ``lease_kind`` — and reports the answer without acting
on it: no lease is acquired and no health, sticky or selection state is
written. The runtime lock is held only for the balancer's ordinary state
preparation (stale-lease reclaim, runtime prune, state build), exactly as
ordinary selection does, and is released before the selector runs.

``observe_only`` turns the check into a pure observation: states are built
from a detached snapshot of the runtime (the Force Probe settlement pattern) on
which stale leases are expired exactly as the live path expires them, so the
answer matches the live check while not even the usage-derived health-tier
refresh, its ``version`` / ``health_version`` bumps, or the lease housekeeping
touch the live balancer.
The read-only pool-exhaustion probe (``exhaustion_probe.py``) rides on this
path with ``lease_kind=None``, so a ``usage_limit_reached`` answer there is the
spec's 429 predicate evaluated over the request's own eligible pool.
