"""Single-owner lifecycle for a dispatched model-source attempt (#2123 WP-C1).

Every request forwarded to an OpenAI-compatible model source is owned by
exactly one ``SourceDispatch`` that ends in exactly one ``finish()`` (I10): the
source connection is closed, the API-key reservation is settled or released
exactly once (I3), the admission claims are released, and one request-log row
is written per attempt -- each step independently latched and failure-isolated
(design v3 §6). ``abandon()`` is the cancellation-class ``finish()`` for a
client that left during the open or before the body started (§6.4 table).

Composition rules:

* the settlement generator (``settlement_stream``) is the *outermost* body
  layer for every composition: it sees the terminal outcome and the
  cancellation first, and it owns the reservation;
* ``SourceStreamingResponse.__call__`` wraps the transport in
  ``try/finally: _await_cleanup_deferring_cancellation(owner.finalize_transport(), scheduler=owner.scheduler)``
  so a client that leaves before Starlette starts the body still reaches one
  ``finish()``; the direct chat-completions stream route, which has no
  dispatch owner, hands the same response class a ``SourceChatStreamOwner``
  so its never-started body closes the source transport too;
* the handler segment uses ``except BaseException -> abandon(); raise``
  (``CancelledError`` is a ``BaseException`` and is never caught by
  ``except Exception``);
* every timer, wait and task spawn goes through ``owner.scheduler`` /
  ``owner.clock`` (``scripts/check_proxy_timing_seams.py`` has a zero
  allowance for this module) and every cleanup await defers cancellation
  (``scripts/check_cancellation_safety.py``).

Settle policy (design §6.1, CL-8/P4/CP-16): ``success`` with usage finalizes
at the source's usage and cost; ``success`` without usage on a limited key
settles at an estimate (never at zero, never released); a cancel *after*
content was delivered to the client (an event frame ``settlement_stream``
handed to the transport -- not the parser's observation, nor the body's flush
point, which sits below wrapper layers that can still drop or park a frame)
on a limited key settles at the estimate (a key must not consume most of an
answer and disconnect unmetered); a cancel before it, and every
``error``, release. A stream the source ends with a failure terminal, or
closes without any terminal the client could complete on, is an ``error``
(``model_source_response_failed`` / ``model_source_stream_truncated``) and
releases: the client received a failure, so nothing is charged. Estimates are
never written to the request-log row
as usage -- they are visible through the WARN line and the
``codex_lb_model_source_usage_estimated_total`` counter.

The overflow decision (WP-C2) supplies ``request_log_source``,
``dispatch_kind`` and the pin intent; this module never spells the
designation itself.

    """Outermost body layer: settles/releases on the terminal outcome and calls ``owner.finish()`` in ``finally``.

    A disconnect surfaces as ``CancelledError`` (task cancellation) or
    ``GeneratorExit`` (``aclose()`` from ``finalize_transport``); both bypass
    ``except Exception`` and are recorded as ``cancelled`` (the settle policy
    decides between release and estimate) unless the client already received a
    terminal: a relayed failure terminal is an ``error``, a relayed success
    terminal a ``success``. A verified pin non-write yields the
    synthesized ``response.created`` + ``response.failed`` pair after the
    reservation was released and the source closed.

    Delivery is decided here as well: ``owner.content_delivered`` is set when
    an event frame ``relayed_frame_delivers_content`` classifies as content is
    handed to the transport, so the cancel estimate charges only for frames
    that left the proxy. The body's flush point sits below the public wrapper,
    which drops events outside ``response.*`` / ``error`` under the SDK
    contract, parks ``response.*`` frames ahead of ``response.created`` and
    holds reasoning-summary deltas; a chunk the body flushed may therefore
    never reach the client (the one ``send()`` in flight when the client
    leaves is the residual ambiguity, resolved as delivered).

    The client-visible terminal is latched from the relayed event frames, not
    read from the last one: a typed event trailing a terminal (a delta the
    source keeps emitting after the wrapper rewrote its ``response.completed``
    into ``response.failed``, a vendor frame after ``response.completed``)
    must not reset the classification, and a relayed failure terminal is
    sticky -- once the client received a failure, nothing that follows turns
    the attempt back into a charged success. The latch costs one
    ``startswith`` and a string slice per ``event:``-framed event; only a raw
    data-only pass-through block (a native-mode terminal, an unparseable
    block) pays a JSON parse.
