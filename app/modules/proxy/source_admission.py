"""Per-source bulkhead and admission claims for model-source dispatch (#2123 WP-C1).

A replica enforces ``ModelSource.max_concurrency`` (``NULL`` = unlimited)
before the request reserves API-key usage, so a saturated source answers
``503 model_source_busy`` with nothing owned (design v3 §6, §8.4). The claim is
handed to exactly one ``SourceDispatch`` owner (``transfer_to``) and released
exactly once by whichever latch holds it (I13): ``release_if_unowned`` by the
route helper when the owner was never built, ``release`` from the owner's
``finish()``. The ``trial`` slot is filled by the overflow breaker (WP-C2);
with ``trial=None`` a ``TrialResult`` records nothing.

The bulkhead is a plain dictionary increment on the request path (design §12):
no lock is needed because every mutation happens synchronously on the event
loop between two awaits.
