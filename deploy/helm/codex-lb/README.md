# codex-lb Helm Chart

Production-ready Helm chart for [codex-lb](https://github.com/soju06/codex-lb), an OpenAI API load balancer with account pooling, usage tracking, and dashboard.

## Design Goal

This chart is organized around **install modes**, not cloud vendors.

The same chart should work on Docker Desktop, kind, EKS, GKE, OKE, and other Kubernetes distributions. Cluster-specific concerns such as storage classes, ingress classes, load balancer annotations, and secret backends are expressed through values, while the application install contract stays the same.

## Prerequisites

- Helm 3.7+
- Kubernetes 1.32+
- Optional:
  - Prometheus Operator for `ServiceMonitor` and `PrometheusRule`
  - cert-manager for automated ingress TLS
  - Gateway API CRDs for `HTTPRoute`
  - External Secrets Operator for `externalSecrets.enabled=true`

## Version Policy

- Minimum supported Kubernetes version: `1.32`
- Validation baseline in CI and smoke installs: `1.35`

This is a project support policy. Cloud providers may keep older versions available for some time, but the chart and CI no longer optimize for pre-`1.32` clusters.

## Install Modes

### 1. Bundled

Use the bundled Bitnami PostgreSQL sub-chart. This is the easiest self-contained install mode for demos, development clusters, and disposable environments.

Key properties:

- `postgresql.enabled=true`
- `values-bundled.yaml` enables `databaseMigrateOnStartup=true`
- the migration Job is reserved for upgrades (`pre-upgrade`)
- fresh installs stay self-contained and single-replica friendly

Example:

```bash
helm install codex-lb oci://ghcr.io/soju06/charts/codex-lb \
  --set postgresql.auth.password=change-me \
  --set config.databaseMigrateOnStartup=true \
  --set migration.schemaGate.enabled=false
```

<details>
<summary>From source</summary>

```bash
helm dependency build deploy/helm/codex-lb/
helm upgrade --install codex-lb deploy/helm/codex-lb/ \
  -f deploy/helm/codex-lb/values-bundled.yaml \
  --set postgresql.auth.password=change-me
```

</details>

### 2. External DB

Use an already reachable PostgreSQL database. This is the preferred production contract when the database is managed separately.

Key properties:

- `postgresql.enabled=false`
- direct DB URL or DB secret is available at install time
- migration Job runs `pre-install,pre-upgrade`
- application pods still keep the schema gate initContainer enabled

Supported DB wiring:

- `externalDatabase.url`
- `externalDatabase.host`, `externalDatabase.port`, `externalDatabase.database`, `externalDatabase.user`
- `externalDatabase.existingSecret`
- `auth.existingSecret` if one secret contains both `database-url` and `encryption-key`

Example using a direct URL:

```bash
helm install codex-lb oci://ghcr.io/soju06/charts/codex-lb \
  --set postgresql.enabled=false \
  --set externalDatabase.url='postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@db.example.com:5432/codexlb'
```

Example using separate secrets:

```bash
helm install codex-lb oci://ghcr.io/soju06/charts/codex-lb \
  --set postgresql.enabled=false \
  --set externalDatabase.existingSecret=codex-lb-db \
  --set auth.existingSecret=codex-lb-app
```

<details>
<summary>From source</summary>

```bash
helm upgrade --install codex-lb deploy/helm/codex-lb/ \
  -f deploy/helm/codex-lb/values-external-db.yaml \
  --set externalDatabase.url='postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@db.example.com:5432/codexlb'
```

</details>

### 3. External Secrets

Use External Secrets Operator to materialize credentials.

Key properties:

- `externalSecrets.enabled=true`
- requires External Secrets Operator v0.17.0 or newer (the first release that serves `external-secrets.io/v1`)
- DB credentials are not assumed to exist at render time
- remote secret keys and optional JSON properties are configurable independently
- migration Job remains `post-install,pre-upgrade`
- application pods keep the schema gate initContainer enabled and wait for schema head before starting the app container

Example:

```bash
helm install codex-lb oci://ghcr.io/soju06/charts/codex-lb \
  --set postgresql.enabled=false \
  --set externalSecrets.enabled=true \
  --set externalSecrets.secretStoreRef.name=my-store
```

<details>
<summary>From source</summary>

```bash
helm upgrade --install codex-lb deploy/helm/codex-lb/ \
  -f deploy/helm/codex-lb/values-external-secrets.yaml \
  --set externalSecrets.secretStoreRef.name=my-store
```

</details>

By default, both values are read from JSON properties in a remote secret named
after the release. Providers such as Infisical commonly store each value as an
individual secret instead. Configure absolute keys and clear the property fields
for that layout:

```yaml
externalSecrets:
  enabled: true
  secretStoreRef:
    name: infisical
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  remoteRefs:
    databaseUrl:
      key: /apps/codex-lb/DATABASE_URL
      property: ""
    encryptionKey:
      key: /apps/codex-lb/ENCRYPTION_KEY
      property: ""
```

## Quick Start

No repo clone required — install directly from the OCI registry.

### Docker Desktop / kind style cluster

Bundled PostgreSQL:

```bash
helm install codex-lb oci://ghcr.io/soju06/charts/codex-lb \
  --set postgresql.auth.password=local-dev-password \
  --set config.databaseMigrateOnStartup=true \
  --set migration.schemaGate.enabled=false
```

### Managed PostgreSQL

```bash
helm install codex-lb oci://ghcr.io/soju06/charts/codex-lb \
  --set postgresql.enabled=false \
  --set externalDatabase.url='postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@db.example.com:5432/codexlb'
```

### From source (development)

If you need to customize the chart itself, clone the repo and install from path:

```bash
helm dependency build deploy/helm/codex-lb/
helm upgrade --install codex-lb deploy/helm/codex-lb/ \
  -f deploy/helm/codex-lb/values-bundled.yaml \
  --set postgresql.auth.password=local-dev-password
```

## Included Value Overlays

Mode-centric overlays:

- `values-bundled.yaml`
- `values-external-db.yaml`
- `values-external-secrets.yaml`

Environment-oriented overlays kept for convenience:

- `values-dev.yaml`
- `values-staging.yaml`
- `values-prod.yaml`

The mode overlays define the installation contract. The environment overlays tune scale, observability, and routing posture.

## Schema and Migration Behavior

This chart intentionally keeps migration behavior explicit by install mode.

- In external DB and external secrets modes, the chart relies on the dedicated migration Job to advance schema.
- Application pods use a schema gate initContainer when `migration.enabled=true`, `config.databaseMigrateOnStartup=false`, and `migration.schemaGate.enabled=true`.
- That initContainer runs `python -m app.db.migrate wait-for-head` and blocks the app container until the database is at Alembic head.
- In bundled mode, `values-bundled.yaml` enables startup migration instead of the schema gate so fresh self-contained installs do not deadlock on `helm install --wait`.

This means:

- bundled PostgreSQL installs bootstrap themselves without requiring a separate install-time migration writer
- external DB installs with direct credentials can migrate before StatefulSet creation
- external secrets installs fail closed instead of serving on a stale schema

## Secret Model

The chart supports two secret patterns.

### Single secret

Use `auth.existingSecret` when one secret contains both:

- `database-url`
- `encryption-key`

### Split secrets

Use `externalDatabase.existingSecret` for the database URL and let the chart manage or reference a separate app secret for `encryption-key`.

When `externalDatabase.existingSecret` is set and `auth.existingSecret` is not, the chart-managed app secret contains only the encryption key; the StatefulSet reads `CODEX_LB_DATABASE_URL` from the external DB secret.

## Network Policy

When `networkPolicy.enabled=true`, the chart now fails closed for the main HTTP ingress port.

- The chart does **not** open port `2455` to every namespace by default.
- To allow ingress-controller traffic, set `networkPolicy.ingressNSMatchLabels`.
- For custom cases, use `networkPolicy.extraIngress`.

Example:

```yaml
networkPolicy:
  enabled: true
  ingressNSMatchLabels:
    kubernetes.io/metadata.name: ingress-nginx
```

`values-prod.yaml` ships this allowlist by default (matching an ingress-nginx controller in the `ingress-nginx` namespace); adjust the labels if your controller runs elsewhere. If you enable `networkPolicy` together with `ingress` in a hand-rolled overlay and omit the allowlist, external traffic through the controller is denied on port `2455` while pods stay Ready — the rendered install NOTES warn about this combination.

## Connection Pool Sizing

Normative contracts: [database backends](../../../openspec/specs/database-backends/)
and [deployment installation](../../../openspec/specs/deployment-installation/).

Each supported pod runs one application worker with two independent SQLAlchemy
pools: one for request-path work and one for background tasks.

```
total_connections = (databasePoolSize + databaseMaxOverflow) × 2 pools × 1 worker × replicas
```

Keep this within your PostgreSQL `max_connections` budget, including capacity
for migrations and administrative clients, or place PgBouncer in front of the
database.

The owned `app.cli` launcher explicitly pins Uvicorn to one worker, so
`WEB_CONCURRENCY` does not multiply pools. Custom Uvicorn/Gunicorn multi-worker
launchers are unsupported; scale through replicas or the HPA.

## Production Workload

Multi-replica production deployments require careful coordination of database connectivity, session routing, and graceful shutdown. This section covers the key patterns and tuning parameters.

### Prerequisites for Multi-Replica

Single-replica deployments can use SQLite, but **multi-replica requires PostgreSQL**:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL is mandatory for multi-replica because:
  - SQLite does not support concurrent writes from multiple pods
  - Leader election requires a shared database backend
  - Session bridge ring membership is stored in the database
  
- **Leader Election**: Enabled by default (`config.leaderElectionEnabled=true`)
  - Ensures only one pod performs background tasks (e.g., session cleanup, metrics aggregation)
  - Uses database-backed locking with a TTL (`config.leaderElectionTtlSeconds=30`)
  - If the leader crashes, another pod acquires the lock within 30 seconds
  
- **Circuit Breaker**: Enabled by default (`config.circuitBreakerEnabled=true`)
  - Protects upstream API endpoints from cascading failures
  - Opens after 5 consecutive failures; enters half-open state after 60
    seconds (fixed application constants)
  - Prevents thundering herd when upstream is degraded

### Session Bridge Ring

The session bridge is an in-memory cache of upstream WebSocket connections, shared across the pod ring.

**Automatic Ring Membership (PostgreSQL)**

When using PostgreSQL, ring membership is **automatic and database-backed**:

- Each pod registers itself in the database on startup
- Each pod auto-advertises its owner-handoff endpoint via headless-service DNS
- The `sessionBridgeInstanceRing` field is **optional** and only needed for manual pod list override
- Pods discover each other via database queries; no manual configuration required
- Ring membership is cleaned up automatically when pods terminate

The chart configures each pod with:

- StatefulSet name: `<release>-codex-lb-workload`
- `serviceName: <release>-codex-lb-bridge` on the StatefulSet
- `CODEX_LB_HTTP_RESPONSES_SESSION_BRIDGE_INSTANCE_ID=$(POD_NAME)`
- `CODEX_LB_HTTP_RESPONSES_SESSION_BRIDGE_ADVERTISE_BASE_URL=http://$(POD_NAME).<headless-service>.$(POD_NAMESPACE).svc.<clusterDomain>:2455`

`clusterDomain` defaults to `cluster.local`. If your cluster uses another suffix, set:

```yaml
clusterDomain: corp.internal
```

In most clusters no extra values are required for `/responses` owner handoff. If pods must be reached through a different internal address, the override must stay **per-pod**: the application refuses to start when the advertise hostname is not replica-specific, so a shared Service hostname crashloops every replica. Use the kubelet `$(POD_NAME)` expansion — the chart defines `POD_NAME` earlier in the container env list, so the kubelet expands it per pod:

```yaml
config:
  sessionBridgeAdvertiseBaseUrl: "http://$(POD_NAME).codex-lb-bridge.default.svc.cluster.local:2455"
```

Replace `codex-lb-bridge`, `default`, and `cluster.local` with your headless service name (`<release>-bridge` by default), namespace, and cluster domain. For a release named `codex-lb` the first pod then advertises `http://codex-lb-workload-0.codex-lb-bridge.default.svc.cluster.local:2455`.

When `networkPolicy.enabled=true`, the chart also allows port `2455` traffic between codex-lb pods so owner handoff can work without extra rules.

**Manual Ring Override (Advanced)**

If you need to manually specify the pod ring (e.g., for testing or debugging), list the **bare StatefulSet pod names**. Each pod's bridge instance id is `$(POD_NAME)`, and the application requires its instance id to appear literally in the ring — FQDN entries fail Settings validation and crashloop the pods:

```yaml
config:
  sessionBridgeInstanceRing: "codex-lb-workload-0,codex-lb-workload-1"
```

A static ring is incompatible with autoscaling and must list exactly the StatefulSet pod names (`<workload-name>-0` through `<workload-name>-<replicaCount - 1>`); the chart refuses to render when `autoscaling.enabled=true`, when any expected pod name is missing from the ring, or when a ring entry does not match any expected pod name (for example FQDN-style entries). This is rarely needed in production; the database-backed discovery is preferred.

### Connection Pool Budget

Each supported pod maintains one worker with two independent SQLAlchemy
connection pools: the request pool and the background-task pool. The total
connections across all replicas must leave room within PostgreSQL's
`max_connections` for reserved slots, migrations, and operations:

```
(databasePoolSize + databaseMaxOverflow) × 2 × 1 × maxReplicas ≤ PostgreSQL max_connections - reserve
```

**Example for `values-prod.yaml`:**

```yaml
config:
  databasePoolSize: 1
  databaseMaxOverflow: 1
autoscaling:
  maxReplicas: 20
```

Calculation: `(1 + 1) × 2 × 20 = 80` application connections. This fits
within PostgreSQL's default `max_connections=100` while reserving 20
raw server slots: three default superuser-reserved slots, two simultaneous
migrator connections, and fifteen further operational connections.

**Tuning:**

- Increase `databasePoolSize` if pods frequently wait for connections
- Increase `databaseMaxOverflow` for temporary spikes, but keep it small (overflow is slower)
- Reduce `maxReplicas` if you cannot increase PostgreSQL's `max_connections`
- Use PgBouncer or pgcat as a connection pooler in front of PostgreSQL if needed

### values-prod.yaml Reference

The `values-prod.yaml` overlay is pre-configured for production multi-replica deployments:

```yaml
replicaCount: 3                    # Start with 3 replicas
postgresql:
  enabled: false                   # Use external PostgreSQL
autoscaling:
  enabled: true
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 20
  behavior:
    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 600  # 10 min cooldown (see below)
affinity:
  podAntiAffinity: hard            # Spread pods across nodes
topologySpreadConstraints:
  - maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone  # Spread across zones
networkPolicy:
  enabled: true                    # Restrict ingress/egress
  ingressNSMatchLabels:            # REQUIRED with ingress: allow the controller namespace
    kubernetes.io/metadata.name: ingress-nginx
ingress:
  enabled: true
  nginx:
    enabled: true                  # Streaming-safety + sticky-hash annotations as one set
metrics:
  serviceMonitor:
    enabled: true                  # Prometheus scraping
  prometheusRule:
    enabled: true                  # Alerting rules
  grafanaDashboard:
    enabled: true                  # Pre-built dashboards
externalSecrets:
  enabled: true                    # Use External Secrets Operator
```

The Grafana sidecar imports the dashboard JSON but does not provision
datasources or database credentials. In the **codex-lb TTFT Breakdown**
dashboard, select the Grafana PostgreSQL datasource that points to the
codex-lb database from the visible **PostgreSQL** (`DS_SQL`) dropdown. All
four SQL panels follow that one runtime selection. The owning contract is in
[proxy runtime observability](../../../openspec/specs/proxy-runtime-observability/).

Install with:

```bash
helm install codex-lb oci://ghcr.io/soju06/charts/codex-lb \
  -f deploy/helm/codex-lb/values-prod.yaml \
  --set externalDatabase.url='postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@db.example.com:5432/codexlb'
```

### Graceful Shutdown Tuning

Graceful shutdown coordinates one application drain deadline plus a Kubernetes hard deadline:
The owning requirements live in the
[deployment-installation OpenSpec capability](../../../openspec/specs/deployment-installation/).

```
preStop starts shared config.shutdownDrainTimeoutSeconds (30s)
├─ preStopSleepSeconds routing dwell (15s default)
└─ in-flight drain until zero or the shared deadline
terminationGracePeriodSeconds (65s) bounds preStop, SIGTERM, and final cleanup
```

**Timeline:**

1. **preStop / preStopSleepSeconds (15s default)**: Pod termination begins
   - Calls `/internal/drain/start` so readiness fails and new app requests are rejected
   - When the Python helper starts, it establishes the routing-dwell clock and sends that helper-anchored monotonic deadline to the loopback endpoint; that deadline-bearing call commits the one-way shutdown barrier
   - The app clamps the deadline to its configured timeout and returns the effective absolute deadline for the hook to reuse
   - Starts the same `config.shutdownDrainTimeoutSeconds` deadline later reused by SIGTERM
   - Measures routing dwell from Python helper start; the local start request consumes that same budget
   - Polls `/internal/drain/status`, then exits after dwell when `in_flight=0`
   - On start/status failure, exits promptly so SIGTERM becomes the fallback
   
2. **SIGTERM / remaining shared drain budget**:
   - Does not restart or extend the deadline established by preStop
   - Stops accepting new HTTP and WebSocket work
   - Lets admitted Responses turns finish terminal delivery, persistence, and settlement within the remaining budget
   
3. **terminationGracePeriodSeconds (65s default)**: Hard deadline
   - Starts before the preStop helper process and covers helper launch, preStop, SIGTERM, and final process cleanup before SIGKILL
   - Must be ≥ `config.shutdownDrainTimeoutSeconds + 32`
   - After the helper starts, the extra two seconds cover a failed local drain-start request before direct SIGTERM starts the application budget
   - After the application deadline, the launcher stops awaiting Uvicorn connection or lifespan cleanup after a further 25 seconds; if cleanup remains cancellation-resistant, it forces the captured signal (or SIGTERM for programmatic shutdown), while the remaining five seconds cover signal delivery and ordinary process exit
   - Kubelet's exec/Python launch latency is outside the application's control and consumes only this hard grace, not the application budget. Production overrides should retain headroom above the minimum; the 65-second default includes three additional seconds
   - This post-drain phase is not a second request-drain period

**Tuning:**

- Keep `preStopSleepSeconds <= config.shutdownDrainTimeoutSeconds`
- Increase `preStopSleepSeconds` if your load balancer takes longer to deregister
- Increase `config.shutdownDrainTimeoutSeconds` if requests typically take >30s to complete
- Preserve the fixed 32-second start-fallback and post-drain reserve when changing `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`
- Run one worker per pod/container and scale with replicas; the owned launcher pins one worker and ignores ambient `WEB_CONCURRENCY`

Example for long-running requests:

```yaml
preStopSleepSeconds: 20
config:
  shutdownDrainTimeoutSeconds: 60
terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 95
```

### Scale-Down Caution

The `stabilizationWindowSeconds: 600` (10 minutes) in `values-prod.yaml` is intentionally high.

**Why?**

- Session bridge connections have fixed idle TTLs (120s for API sessions, 900s for Codex sessions; application constants, not chart values)
- When a pod scales down, its in-memory sessions are lost
- Clients reconnecting to a different pod must re-establish upstream connections
- A 10-minute cooldown prevents rapid scale-down/up cycles that would thrash session state

**Behavior:**

- HPA will scale down at most 1 pod every 2 minutes (when cooldown is active)
- If load drops suddenly, scale-down is delayed by up to 10 minutes
- This trades off faster scale-down for session stability

**Tuning:**

- Reduce `stabilizationWindowSeconds` if you prioritize cost over session stability
- Increase it if you see frequent session reconnections during scale events
- Monitor `sessionBridgeInstanceRing` size changes in logs to detect scale-down impact

## Security

The chart targets the Kubernetes Restricted Pod Security Standard.

- `runAsNonRoot: true`
- `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`
- `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
- all Linux capabilities dropped
- `automountServiceAccountToken: false`

Rollout controls for externally managed config:

- `rollout.reloader.enabled=true` adds Stakater Reloader annotations
- `rollout.manualToken` forces a StatefulSet rollout when external Secret contents change outside Helm

## Ingress and Gateway API

The chart supports either classic Ingress or Gateway API.

Ingress example:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  ingressClassName: nginx
  hosts:
    - host: codex-lb.example.com
      paths:
        - path: /
          pathType: Prefix
```

Gateway API example:

```yaml
gatewayApi:
  enabled: true
  parentRefs:
    - name: my-gateway
      namespace: gateway-system
  hostnames:
    - codex-lb.example.com
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /v1
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /backend-api/codex
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /backend-api/wham
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /backend-api/transcribe
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /backend-api/files
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /api/codex
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
      filters:
        - type: ExtensionRef
          extensionRef:
            group: traefik.io
            kind: Middleware
            name: oauth-forward-auth
```

When `rules` is empty, the chart renders the existing catch-all route. For
custom rules, the chart preserves their order and adds the codex-lb Service as
the backend of every rule. Referenced extension resources must be valid for the
HTTPRoute namespace according to the selected Gateway implementation.

For application-specific Gateway setup, see the
[Kubernetes deployment guide](../../../docs/deployment/kubernetes.md#application-specific-gateway)
and the owning OpenSpec capability, [`deployment-networking`](../../../openspec/specs/deployment-networking/spec.md).

### nginx annotations and responses sticky routing

All nginx-specific annotations are gated behind `ingress.nginx.enabled=true` and render as **one coherent set**: the streaming-safety annotations (proxy buffering off, 3600s read/send timeouts, 50m body size, HTTP/1.1) and the sticky-hash annotations always appear together. Enabling ingress on an nginx class without `ingress.nginx.enabled=true` renders no nginx annotations at all — which means the controller's defaults (60s read timeout, 1m body cap) apply and will cut long-lived SSE/WebSocket streams.

The dedicated responses ingress defaults to a snippet-free sticky key:

```yaml
ingress:
  responses:
    nginx:
      upstreamHashBy: "$http_x_codex_session_id$http_authorization"
```

Undefined nginx `$http_*` variables render empty, so requests carrying `x-codex-session-id` hash by session (+API key) and requests without it hash by the Authorization header alone. This is admitted by stock ingress-nginx at the default `annotations-risk-level`.

Advanced snippet-based keys via `ingress.responses.nginx.configurationSnippet` are opt-in only: stock ingress-nginx >= 1.12 rejects `configuration-snippet` at admission unless the controller runs with `--allow-snippet-annotations=true` and `annotations-risk-level: Critical`.

## Upgrade Contract

```bash
helm upgrade codex-lb oci://ghcr.io/soju06/charts/codex-lb <your values...>
```

**Upgrade warning:** the chart enforces a render-time timing guard. Existing
values files, `--set` overrides, or values retained by
`helm upgrade --reuse-values` with
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds < config.shutdownDrainTimeoutSeconds + 32`
make `helm template`, `helm install`, and `helm upgrade` fail before resources
are applied. With the default `config.shutdownDrainTimeoutSeconds: 30`, the
minimum is `62`; the chart default is `65`. Raise every retained low value
explicitly to at least the computed minimum (`65` preserves the chart's default
headroom for a 30-second drain). Omitting the key does not clear its stored
value when `--reuse-values` is used. To adopt the chart default instead, use an
intentional non-reuse or `--reset-values` upgrade with the key absent. Production
overrides should retain additional helper-launch headroom.

- External DB installs can migrate before StatefulSet creation.
- External secrets installs keep the dedicated migration Job and fail closed behind the schema gate.
- Bundled installs stay easy to bootstrap and keep the migration hook for upgrades.
- StatefulSet pod-template checksums force rollouts when chart-managed ConfigMaps or Secrets change.
- The workload resource name is intentionally different from the legacy Deployment name to avoid Helm kind-migration conflicts during upgrade. Releases first installed before chart 1.13.0 go through the cutover described in [Upgrading](#upgrading).

## Upgrading

`helm upgrade` follows the [Upgrade Contract](#upgrade-contract) above. This
section covers the upgrade paths that need operator attention.

### From chart versions older than 1.13.0

Chart 1.13.0 (codex-lb v1.13.0, April 2026, #363) moved the application from a
`Deployment` named `<fullname>` to a `StatefulSet` named `<fullname>-workload`
so `/responses` owner handoff can address pods by stable name. Helm cannot
change a resource's kind in place, so the chart carries a three-piece shim that
keeps the public Service pointed at the legacy pods while the StatefulSet
starts and then cuts it over:

`<fullname>` below is the chart fullname (`codex-lb.fullname`): the release
name itself when it contains `codex-lb` (release `codex-lb` -> `codex-lb`,
the name used by the install commands in this README), otherwise
`<release>-codex-lb`; `fullnameOverride` replaces both. The hook Job names
truncate the fullname to fit the 63-character limit.

1. **`pre-upgrade` hook `<fullname>-legacy-prepare`**
   (`templates/legacy-deployment-prepare-hook.yaml`): a Job that patches the
   legacy Deployment's pod template with the traffic-lane label
   `codex-lb.soju.dev/traffic: legacy` and waits (up to 10 minutes) for that
   rollout to become ready. When no legacy Deployment exists the Job exits
   immediately.
2. **Service selector `auto` mode** (`templates/service.yaml`,
   `migration.serviceSelectorMode`): during an upgrade the chart looks up the
   existing Service. If its selector has no traffic-lane label yet (a pre-1.13
   release) or still says `legacy`, the Service is rendered with the legacy
   selector so the old pods keep serving while the StatefulSet starts. Once the
   lane is `workload`, it stays `workload`.
3. **`post-upgrade` hook `<fullname>-legacy-cleanup`**
   (`templates/legacy-deployment-cleanup-hook.yaml`): a Job that waits for the
   StatefulSet to reach its desired ready replicas, patches the Service
   selector to `codex-lb.soju.dev/traffic: workload`, then deletes the legacy
   Deployment.

Each hook creates its own ServiceAccount, Role and RoleBinding. Helm deletes
them together with the Job on success
(`helm.sh/hook-delete-policy: before-hook-creation,hook-succeeded`), so a
failed hook leaves its Job and logs behind for inspection.

`migration.serviceSelectorMode`:

| Value | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` (default) | Lookup-based behaviour described above. |
| `legacy` | Render the legacy selector unconditionally. This only controls what the chart renders: the cleanup hook still patches the live Service to `workload` once the StatefulSet is ready, so `legacy` does not suspend the cutover. It only keeps the rendered selector on the legacy pods for as long as the StatefulSet is not ready (a stalled cutover), which `auto` does as well. |
| `workload` | Always select the StatefulSet pods and skip the lookup. Safe once the cutover has completed. |

Verify after the first upgrade from a pre-1.13 release:

```bash
# the Service selects the StatefulSet pods
kubectl get svc <fullname> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.selector}'
# expected to contain "codex-lb.soju.dev/traffic":"workload"

# the legacy Deployment is gone and the StatefulSet is ready
kubectl get deploy <fullname> -n <namespace>   # NotFound
kubectl get sts <fullname>-workload -n <namespace>

# a failed hook keeps its Job for inspection
kubectl logs job/<fullname>-legacy-prepare -n <namespace>
kubectl logs job/<fullname>-legacy-cleanup -n <namespace>
```

For the `codex-lb` release from the install commands above, `<fullname>` is
`codex-lb`: `kubectl get sts codex-lb-workload`, `job/codex-lb-legacy-cleanup`.
A `NotFound` for the Deployment is only meaningful when the StatefulSet exists
and the Service selector already says `workload`.

Notes and opt-out:

- **Plan the first upgrade from a pre-1.13 release as a maintenance window,
  not a zero-downtime rollout.** The chart no longer renders the legacy
  Deployment and nothing marks it `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so Helm
  itself removes it from the release during the upgrade's resource sync, which
  runs before the `post-upgrade` cleanup hook. Its pods can therefore start
  terminating while the Service still selects them and before the StatefulSet
  is ready. The shim bounds the gap (the Service is never pointed at an
  unready StatefulSet, and the cleanup hook waits for readiness before it
  flips the selector); it does not eliminate it.
- The hooks render on every `helm upgrade`, including releases first
  installed on 1.13.0 or later. There they are no-ops (the prepare Job finds no
  Deployment and exits 0; the cleanup Job re-applies the `workload` selector
  and ignores the missing Deployment), but they still create a short-lived Job
  plus RBAC objects and wait for the StatefulSet to be ready. No values switch
  disables them; the planned removal below is the opt-out.
- Do not set `migration.serviceSelectorMode: workload` for the first upgrade
  from a pre-1.13 release: the Service would switch to StatefulSet pods before
  any are ready.
- Client-side rendering cannot perform the `lookup`. `helm template` renders
  the `workload` selector (it is not an upgrade); `helm upgrade --dry-run`
  renders the `legacy` selector because the lookup comes back empty. Use
  `helm upgrade --dry-run=server` to preview what the real upgrade renders, or
  set `migration.serviceSelectorMode: workload` on releases that have completed
  the cutover.

### Deprecation: pre-1.13 migration shim

Planned removal, announced here: the shim above (both legacy-deployment hooks,
the lookup-based `auto` selector mode, the `codex-lb.legacySelectorLabels`
helper and the `migration.serviceSelectorMode` value) is scheduled for removal
in the first minor release after 1.26. After that release:

- the public Service always renders the `workload` selector and
  `migration.serviceSelectorMode` is no longer read;
- `helm upgrade` no longer creates the two hook Jobs and their RBAC objects;
- upgrading a release that is still on a chart older than 1.13.0 requires an
  intermediate upgrade to any 1.13.0 - 1.26.x chart (so the cutover runs)
  before moving to the current chart.

Releases first installed on 1.13.0 or later, and releases that have already
completed the cutover, are not affected.

### Upgrading across 1.24 -> 1.25

codex-lb 1.25 kept moving behaviour tunables out of the environment and into
the dashboard (PRINCIPLES.md P2 / P6). Visible to Helm users:

**Removed environment variables.** `templates/configmap.yaml` no longer
templates these; the application ignores them and logs one
`removed setting(s) ignored` WARN at startup for at least one release (the
names are pruned from the warning list afterwards and stay inert).

| Removed variable | Former chart value | Replacement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CODEX_LB_UPSTREAM_STREAM_TRANSPORT` (#2192) | `config.upstreamStreamTransport` | Settings -> Advanced -> Routing -> Upstream stream transport (`auto` / `http` / `websocket`). Operators who pinned `http` or `websocket` must pin it again in the dashboard after upgrading; persisted `default` rows are migrated to `auto`. |
| `CODEX_LB_OPENAI_CACHE_AFFINITY_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` (#2190) | `config.cacheAffinityMaxAgeSeconds` | The dashboard cache-affinity TTL, which was already the effective source: the env value only seeded the first-created settings row. |
| `CODEX_LB_REQUEST_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`, `CODEX_LB_USAGE_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS` (#2190) | `extraEnv` only | Settings -> Advanced -> Data retention. An empty dashboard value means retention is disabled; set the window once after upgrading. |
| `CODEX_LB_HTTP_DOWNSTREAM_TRANSPORT_POLICY`, `CODEX_LB_WARMUP_MODEL`, `CODEX_LB_HTTP_RESPONSES_SESSION_BRIDGE_GATEWAY_SAFE_MODE` (#2190) | `extraEnv` only | Dashboard settings of the same name (first-boot seeds or never read). |
| `CODEX_LB_OPENAI_PROMPT_CACHE_KEY_DERIVATION_ENABLED` (#2261) | `config.promptCacheKeyDerivationEnabled` | None: proxy-generated prompt-cache-key derivation is always on (it was never turned off in any deployment). |
| `CODEX_LB_STICKY_SESSION_CLEANUP_ENABLED` (#2261) | `config.stickySessionCleanupEnabled` | None: the sticky-session cleanup loop always runs (its interval was already a fixed constant). |
| The other 25 `constantize-core-tunables` names (#2261): upstream SSE / websocket frame and `response.create` budgets, the upstream compact timeout, OAuth and token-refresh timeouts, refresh claim TTL and failure cooldown, admission wait and gate sizes, usage / reset-credits fetch and refresh cadences, the always-on usage refresh / live ingestion / model registry / quota planner switches, HTTP ingress body budgets, inline image fetching and its host allowlist, `CODEX_LB_IMAGES_DEFAULT_MODEL` | `extraEnv` only | None: fixed application constants equal to the former defaults (see `docs/reference/settings.md`). |
| `CODEX_LB_HTTP_RESPONSES_SESSION_BRIDGE_IDLE_TTL_SECONDS`, `CODEX_LB_HTTP_RESPONSES_SESSION_BRIDGE_CODEX_IDLE_TTL_SECONDS` (#2256) | `config.sessionBridgeIdleTtlSeconds`, `config.sessionBridgeCodexIdleTtlSeconds` | None: fixed application constants equal to the former chart defaults (120 s for API sessions, 900 s for Codex sessions). |
| `CODEX_LB_HTTP_RESPONSES_SESSION_BRIDGE_STUCK_GATE_RETIRE_AFTER_SECONDS`, `..._ANCHOR_POISON_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`, `..._SERVER_RECOVERY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `..._CLEAN_CLOSE_RETRY_JITTER_MAX_SECONDS`, `..._OPERATION_LEDGER_ENABLED` (#2256) | `extraEnv` only | None: fixed application constants (300 s stuck gate, poison threshold = retry-circuit threshold of 2, 6 recovery attempts, 0-2 s clean-close jitter, operation ledger always on). An `ANCHOR_POISON_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=1`, `CLEAN_CLOSE_RETRY_JITTER_MAX_SECONDS=0` or `OPERATION_LEDGER_ENABLED=false` override no longer has any effect. |

`values.schema.json` does not reject unknown `config.*` keys, so values files or
`--reuse-values` state that still carry `config.upstreamStreamTransport`,
`config.cacheAffinityMaxAgeSeconds`, `config.promptCacheKeyDerivationEnabled`,
`config.stickySessionCleanupEnabled`, `config.sessionBridgeIdleTtlSeconds` or
`config.sessionBridgeCodexIdleTtlSeconds` render fine and are ignored (nothing
references them). Drop them at your convenience, and drop the raw names from
`extraEnv` to silence the startup WARN.

**Environment variables that became deprecated aliases** (#2220, #2221,
#2224). Two chart values still template settings the dashboard now owns:

| Chart value | Environment variable | Dashboard home |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config.upstreamConnectTimeout` | `CODEX_LB_UPSTREAM_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Settings -> Advanced -> Upstream timeouts |
| `config.circuitBreakerEnabled` | `CODEX_LB_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED` | Settings -> Advanced -> Resilience |

Precedence is code default < environment < dashboard: the chart value is the
effective value only while the dashboard field is left empty (shown as
inherited). Once an operator saves a dashboard value, changing the chart value
and rolling the pods has no effect until the dashboard field is cleared. The
same precedence applies to every setting marked `T3 (dashboard)` in the
[settings reference](https://soju06.github.io/codex-lb/reference/settings/) when
it is passed through `extraEnv` (request budgets, stream idle timeout, SSE
keepalive, soft drain, deterministic failover, routing weights, overload
isolation, per-account caps).

Whether the shadowing is announced depends on the setting. For
`config.upstreamConnectTimeout` and the other timeout/budget, per-account cap,
routing-weight and overload-isolation aliases, startup logs one
`environment value(s) ignored because the dashboard owns the setting` WARN
naming the shadowed variables. The three resilience toggles
(`config.circuitBreakerEnabled` / `CODEX_LB_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED`, soft
drain, deterministic failover) are overridden by a saved dashboard value
without a startup WARN; check the toggle's provenance in Settings -> Advanced
-> Resilience instead. These aliases are slated for removal in a later minor;
move persistent overrides into the dashboard.

## Validation

Recommended after install:

```bash
helm test codex-lb -n <namespace>
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
kubectl logs job/<release>-migrate -n <namespace>
```

If you are using a port-forwarded install:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/codex-lb 2455:2455 -n <namespace>
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2455/health/live
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2455/health/ready
```

## Troubleshooting

Migration Job:

```bash
kubectl describe job <release>-migrate -n <namespace>
kubectl logs job/<release>-migrate -n <namespace>
```

App pod stuck in init:

```bash
kubectl describe pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=codex-lb -n <namespace>
kubectl logs deploy/<release> -c wait-for-schema-head -n <namespace>
```

Health failures:

```bash
kubectl describe deploy <release> -n <namespace>
kubectl logs deploy/<release> -n <namespace>
```
