"""Rebuild a captured Codex Responses request body as a committable fixture.

Pure functions plus a thin CLI. Imports nothing from ``app``: the fixture gate
(``tests/unit/test_codex_body_fixtures.py``) is where this module's field sets
are pinned against the production constants, so the tooling stays runnable on a
checkout without the application environment.

**An allowlist over structure, not a scrubber over text.** The output is
*constructed*, never edited: every node of the captured body is matched against
a rule in ``BODY``, and only what a rule names reaches the fixture. Two kinds of
rule exist and there is no third:

* **Preserved.** A closed domain the replay-safety and parity assertions read --
  an object key, a discriminator value (``type``, ``role``, ``status``,
  ``phase``, ``effort``, ``verbosity``, a JSON Schema keyword), a boolean, a
  number, ``null``, a model slug in slug shape, and the small vocabulary of
  Codex's own tool names. A string outside the declared domain is a *refusal*,
  never a silent rewrite: ``UnsanitisableBodyError`` names the path.
* **Synthesised.** Everything else -- ``instructions``, message ``content``
  text, a ``function_call``'s ``arguments``, a ``function_call_output``'s
  ``output``, a tool ``description``, a JSON Schema property name, an ``enum``
  value, a ``metadata`` key, an ``operation.path``, a URL, every identifier --
  is replaced wholesale. What a replaced string leaves behind is small but not
  nothing, and it is worth naming: whether it was blank (the bit the replay
  predicate reads); for a URL, its scheme, because that is what decides
  account-neutrality; for an identifier, which other identifiers it equalled;
  and for a ``metadata`` key or a JSON Schema property name, its alphabetical
  rank among its siblings, because the numbering is by sorted order so that a
  rebuild of a rebuild is identical.

The predecessor was a denylist: it kept the captured text and rewrote the
substrings a set of regexes recognised. Two rounds of widening those regexes
were each bypassed, the second one measurably --
``PATH=/usr/local/bin:/home/jane/.local/bin`` inside a
``function_call_output.output`` was rewritten to
``PATH=/workspace/repo:/home/jane/.local/bin``, and the rewrite *removed the
privacy gate's trigger*, so the operator's home directory became committable
behind a green gate. Neither failure mode has anywhere to happen here: nothing
rewrites a captured string, and a captured *string* reaches the output only when
a rule names the closed domain it came from. Those domains are enumerated below
-- object keys, discriminator values, JSON Schema keywords, Codex's own tool
names, the account-scoped reference property names -- plus, outside them,
booleans, bounded numbers, a model slug in slug shape, and the residue named
above. Everything else is constructed from the JSON path.

Two things this is *not*. It is not a guarantee about information: cardinality,
array order, the permutation a ``required`` list encodes and the bounded numbers
are all shape, and shape is a channel. And it is not self-evidently true --
``surviving_captured_strings`` is the check, it runs in the CLI before a write
and in the corpus gate over what is committed, and it is a detector with known
blind spots rather than a proof. The thing that keeps operator content out of
the repository is a human reading the diff; the allowlist is what makes that
reading short enough to happen.

What that costs is stated rather than hidden: the committed fixture is no
longer a readable transcript. It records the *shape* of a real Codex body --
every key, every discriminator, every tool declaration's field set, every item
id's presence and every call/output pairing -- and none of its prose. The
replay-safety predicates are a function of exactly that shape, which is why the
gate can assert the recorded skeleton is unchanged by the rebuild.

Absence is preserved and nothing is ever fabricated. A real Responses-Lite body
carries no ``instructions``, no ``tools`` and no ``stream_options``; fabricating
a key the body did not carry would misrepresent the wire, so it is not
written.

A websocket capture is persisted verbatim, so it arrives with the transport's
frame envelope (``type``) around the Responses body. The envelope is dropped
here -- it is not a Responses field -- while ``generate``, which the frame does
carry as a Responses field, goes through the rules like any other value.
