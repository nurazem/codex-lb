"""Pin the test harness's background-loop seam.

The ambient app lifespan must never start a real background loop inside the
suite (SQLite lock flakes, no-op planner decision rows, public GitHub/npm
catalog lookups). tests/conftest.py achieves that by patching the
``build_*_scheduler`` seams in ``app.main`` — not by exporting
``CODEX_LB_*_ENABLED=false`` — so the seam has to be complete: every builder
the lifespan imports is either replaced with a no-op or explicitly listed here
as an always-on maintenance loop the suite tolerates.
