# codex-lb Core Ownership/Continuity/Timeout Model

This directory contains a TLC-checked TLA+ model of the core concurrency
protocol distilled from `spec/evidence/TAXONOMY.md` and
`spec/evidence/taxonomy.csv`.

The model boundary is intentionally small: two replicas, one served account,
and two client turns. Durable DB rows are the only truth; local caches are
modeled as versioned snapshots. Payloads and token counts are omitted.
Continuity anchors carry two things - a provenance class and the account that
owns them:

- `client_anchor`
- `proxy_full_resend_anchor`
- `proxy_delta_anchor`

The owning account is either the served account or the opaque identity
`foreign_account`, which stands for any account other than the one now serving
the turn. That single extra identity is enough to express cross-account anchor
injection without paying for a second full account dimension.

The turn lifecycle distinguishes three waiting phases, because live codex-lb
kills them under three different budgets:

- `queued` - waiting at the admission gate (`gateDeadline`).
- `active` - request dispatched upstream, `response.created` not seen yet.
  This is the **pre-response eventless phase** (`preResponseDeadline`), and its
  phase resets still consume the same request budget.
- `streaming` - response started, incremental events flowing
  (`phaseElapsed` is the resettable idle clock, bounded by `StreamIdleBudget`;
  healthy progress is not killed by the pre-start total request budget).

## Files

- `CoreOwnership.tla` - raw TLA+ model of account ownership, reservations,
  bridge/websocket turn lifecycle, anchors and anchor account ownership, owner
  epochs, gate waiters, snapshot freshness, completed-delivery finalizer
  ownership, shutdown drain, bounded deadline expiry with a separate
  pre-response eventless timer, and bounded client retry backoff.
- `CoreOwnership.cfg` - full model configuration. `check.sh` runs TLC without
  the `-deadlock` opt-out, so TLC deadlock checking stays enabled.
- `StreamIdleRegression.tla` / `stream-idle-regression.cfg` - exhaustive scripted
  regression: four one-tick progress events survive past the three-tick total
  budget, then three silent ticks terminate the stream.
- `weak-*.cfg` - negative controls that set one weakening flag at a time.
- `check.sh` - verifies the pinned `tla2tools.jar` sha256, downloads through a
  temporary file before replacing the cache, runs the full model under a
  wall-clock budget, then runs all weakenings and requires each one to fail
  with its mapped invariant name (or, for a liveness control, with its mapped
  temporal property and no invariant violation at all).
- `evidence/TAXONOMY.md` and `evidence/taxonomy.csv` - taxonomy inputs used to
  classify the historical bug exemplars.

## Checked Invariants

| Invariant | Requirement | Demonstrating action / weakening |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Inv1AnchorCurrent` | Anchor dispatch/use requires current owner epoch, compatible lineage, and safe provenance. | `AcquireTurn` rejects mismatched lineage before dispatch; `UseAnchor` records unsafe reuse and fires at most once per anchor value. `weak-ignore-owner-epoch.cfg` demonstrates stale anchor reuse, while `weak-ignore-anchor-lineage.cfg` admits an otherwise current same-account anchor with incompatible lineage and records the violation only when `UseAnchor` accepts it. |
| `Inv2DeadlineOrdering` | Pre-start deadlines stay ordered and every gate/connect/first-byte wait respects its independent resource budget. | Active-phase transitions carry the remaining request budget; started streams use a separate resettable idle budget. The shared-timeout control keeps all deadlines equal but violates a phase bound, rather than artificially reversing deadline order. |
| `Inv3ReservationSettledExactlyOnce` | Every acquired terminal turn has exactly one settlement event and a settled reservation state. | `CompleteTurn`, `CancelTurn`, `ExpireDeadline`, and `FinalizeCompletedDelivery` increment `settlementCount`; `weak-skip-release-on-cancel.cfg`, `weak-double-settle.cfg`, and `weak-popped-not-finalized.cfg` demonstrate zero, double, and lost-finalizer failures. |
| `Inv4FreshSnapshots` | Routing cannot use a local snapshot behind durable freshness evidence. | Normal `RouteFromSnapshot` records the routed replica, account, and durable version; `AcquireTurn` rechecks that version before dispatch. `weak-stale-cache.cfg` removes the route-time guard, while `weak-stale-route-acquire.cfg` invalidates an initially fresh route before acquisition and removes the consumption-time guard. |
| `Inv5SingleOwnerCAS` | Singleton/account work mutates under a single durable owner epoch, and the live turn is the replica/epoch that durable row names. | `AcquireTurn` enforces empty durable ownership and no live turn on the same account; the invariant also pins each live turn's replica and epoch to `owner`/`ownerEpoch`, so reassigning the durable owner under a live turn is a violation rather than an unchecked state. `weak-non-atomic-claim.cfg` demonstrates duplicate live owners. |
| `Inv6TerminalIsolation` | Late producer events after completion, cancellation, or failure stay with their originating turn; terminal reason is present. | `DeliverProducer` handles acquired terminal producers, including discard after cancel/failure. Three independent misroute controls cover completed, cancelled, and failed origins. |
| `Inv7GateAccounting` | Every gate waiter is exactly queued, holding, or terminal and keeps the inherited deadline. | `QueueTurn`, `AcquireTurn`, and terminal actions preserve the gate lattice; `weak-lost-waiter.cfg` demonstrates a dropped queued waiter. |
| `Inv8ShutdownDrain` | Draining forbids admission of new externally visible work; shutdown completion requires no registered work and no successful response awaiting downstream producer delivery. | `QueueTurn` is gated by `CanAdmit`; `CompleteShutdown` blocks on both registered work and `producerDelivered`; `weak-shutdown-admit.cfg` demonstrates post-drain admission. |
| `Inv9TerminalOwnerReleased` | Every acquired terminal turn releases the durable owner slot and finalizer owner. | Terminal actions call epoch-fenced release; `weak-leak-owner-on-terminal.cfg` demonstrates a leaked owner lease. |
| `Inv10AnchorAccountOwnership` | A request never dispatches with a continuity anchor owned by a different account, and no turn past admission carries a foreign-owned anchor. | `AcquireTurn` refuses a foreign-owned injected anchor (the injection is weakening-only, like `MisrouteProducer`) and records `crossAccountDispatch`; same-account anchors still come from `StartStream` and are shown usable by `UseAnchor`, so the guard is not vacuous. `UpstreamRespondsTo` makes `response.created`/`response.completed` unreachable for a foreign anchor, so the weakened turn wedges in the pre-response phase. `weak-cross-account-anchor.cfg` demonstrates it. |
| `Inv11PreResponseBudget` | The pre-response eventless bound is derived from the named budgets - it is the minimum of the owner-side gate-retire and stream-idle budgets, stays at or above the keepalive cadence floor until earlier active waits have consumed part of the request budget, and no kill is ever reported under the post-start stream-idle budget while the response had not started. | `QueueTurn` assigns `preResponseDeadline`/`gateRetireDeadline` from named budgets; the active-phase transitions clamp carried budget after every elapsed wait before resetting phase time; `ExpireDeadline` picks its bound and its budget label per phase and records `mislabeledKill`; `weak-conflated-timers.cfg` demonstrates a single shared timer name killing a healthy pre-start wait under the wrong budget. |

The full configuration also checks natural liveness properties:

- `TurnTermination`: every admitted turn eventually reaches a terminal state.
  This assumes weak fairness of successful completion as well as `Tick`,
  `ExpireDeadline`, and `FinalizeCompletedDelivery`. A progressing stream
  need not exhaust an idle budget; completion fairness is necessary for it.
- `ShutdownEventuallyComplete`: committed shutdown drain eventually completes
  once registered work has left and successful responses have reached terminal
  downstream delivery.
- `TearEventuallyRecovers`: a recoverable tear (a turn killed in the
  pre-response eventless phase) is eventually recovered by the client. This
  holds only under the bounded-delay assumption on `retryBackoff`: while the
  backoff stays inside `MaxRetryBackoff` a retry is always eventually due, so
  `WF_vars(ClientRetrySucceeds)` can discharge it.

## Negative Controls

Each weakening is a TLC constant value for `Weakening`. The full model uses
`Weakening = "none"`. `check.sh` treats a passing weakening, a missing
counterexample trace, or a counterexample against the wrong invariant as a
failure. The liveness control additionally fails if it violates any invariant,
or if its config does not declare exactly the mapped temporal property.

## Live Evidence Mapping, 2026-08-06

The three newest controls come from the 2026-08-06 keepalive-window incident on
the live blue-green stack rather than from historical commits, so their
exemplar column carries PR numbers and the incident date instead of fix SHAs.

- **`weak-cross-account-anchor.cfg` -> `Inv10AnchorAccountOwnership`.** The
  incident root cause was an injected `previous_response_id` owned by a
  *different* account. Upstream accepts such a request and then never emits
  `response.created`, so the turn sits in the pre-response eventless phase
  until a timer kills it and the client re-presents the same dead anchor. That
  is exactly what the model reproduces: with the guard removed, `AcquireTurn`
  sets `crossAccountDispatch`, and `UpstreamRespondsTo` makes `StartStream`,
  `CompleteTurn`, and `ClaimCompletedDelivery` unreachable for that turn.
  Fixed live as PR `1638`, *never inject a cross-account previous_response_id
  anchor*. Session-level evidence for the resulting dead-anchor loops is in
  `memory/codex-lb-formal/incidents/2026-08-06-keepalive-window/SESSIONS_TRACE.md`
  (sessions `a0eb3b03df19` and `33755fa72727`, durable rows `60732a9c...` and
  `8e04f345...`, retry circuits at 10 and 7 consecutive `stream_idle_timeout`
  failures). The `bridge_reconnect_account_swap` torn state proven in
  `memory/codex-lb-formal/EVENT_BUGS.md` is the same account-identity hazard
  seen from the reconnect side.
- **`weak-conflated-timers.cfg` -> `Inv11PreResponseBudget`.** The audit in
  `memory/codex-lb-formal/MISCLASS.md` proved the `keepalive_count=6
  max_keepalive_count=6` kill is a *pre-response-start* event-queue silence
  timer worth `6 * 10s = 60s`, not the configured `stream_idle_timeout_seconds
  = 7200s` it was reported as, and that it sat below the `300s` owner-side
  missing-created gate instead of being related to it. The saved incident
  corpus has `788` `HTTP bridge stream idle timeout` lines and `57/64` reader
  failures with `response_events_seen=0`, while healthy `gpt-5.6-luna` turns
  had a first-upstream-event p95 of `930 ms` - so the label was wrong, not the
  traffic. Fixed as PR `1633`, *name the pre-response eventless timeout
  honestly and derive its budget from settings*; the model encodes the shipped
  derivation `min(gate_retire, stream_idle)` floored by the keepalive cadence.
  The weakening restores the single shared name and TLC produces a healthy
  pre-start wait killed under the `stream_idle` budget.
- **`weak-unbounded-backoff.cfg` -> `TearEventuallyRecovers`.** Both wedged
  interactive sessions in `SESSIONS_TRACE.md` looped half-open -> circuit open
  -> reattach for hours with growing cooldowns, and the client side answered
  with ever longer sleeps - the observed extreme being a 29-hour client retry
  gap. Cooldown expiry is a retry gate, not a dead-anchor cleanup, so nothing
  in that loop bounded the delay. The model states the bounded-delay assumption
  explicitly (`ClientRetryAttempt` requires `retryBackoff <= MaxRetryBackoff`)
  and the weakening lets `GrowRetryBackoff` push the delay past it forever;
  TLC then produces a behaviour where `clientRetry = "torn"` never becomes
  `"recovered"`. PR `1634`, *complete Codex compaction SSE lifecycle*, is the
  live counterpart on the recovery path: a thread-recovery stream that
  completed an output item for a response that was never created left stateful
  clients waiting and retrying instead of finishing. The unbounded
  `event_queue.get()` proven in `memory/codex-lb-formal/EVENT_BUGS.md`
  (candidate 1, reachable when `sse_keepalive_interval_seconds <= 0`) is the
  server-side twin of the same "no bound, no recovery" shape, and is why
  `Inv11PreResponseBudget` requires the pre-response bound to exist and stay at
  or above the keepalive cadence floor.

The `2026-08-06` incident also proved dead durable anchors surviving process
kills (`docker stop` grace `10s` against a committed `30s + 25s` app drain, so
`app/main.py` bridge cleanup never ran) and a same-container restart reusing
the bridge instance id, so the startup purge did not retire the previous
process's rows. That is a deploy-side inequality and a durable-identity gap
rather than a new core-protocol invariant; it is tracked in
`memory/codex-lb-formal/incidents/2026-08-06-keepalive-window/INCIDENT.md` and
listed under Future Work below.

## Conformance Gap Modeled

The model includes `completed_delivery_claimed`, `poppedFromPending`,
`completedDeliveryClaimed`, `finalizerOwner`, and `finalizerAborted`. The full
model requires the claimed completed delivery to be finalized before becoming
terminal; `weak-popped-not-finalized.cfg` permits the abort transition that the
conformance review confirmed from the implementation and proves it violates
`Inv3ReservationSettledExactlyOnce`.

## Running

```sh
bash spec/check.sh
```

Expected result: the full model reports no violation with deadlock checking
enabled; all weakening runs fail with their mapped invariant names, and the
liveness control fails with its mapped temporal property while keeping every
invariant. The script prints the distinct-state count for the full model and
every weakening so the checked state-space size is visible. The scripted
stream-idle regression must also finish exhaustively; its bounded trace is not
a proof that the full two-turn model has been exhausted.

### The full model is budgeted, not exhausted

The weakenings all finish in seconds because TLC stops at the first
counterexample. The full model has no counterexample to stop at, and its state
space is much larger than a reviewer will sit through: a 12-worker run with a
24 GB heap was still expanding at 46.2M distinct states and depth 24 after 40
minutes, with 7.5M states left on the queue.

So `check.sh` runs the full model under
`CODEX_LB_TLC_FULL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 1800) and labels the outcome
honestly:

- `PASS full: ...` - the state space really was exhausted within the budget.
- `PARTIAL full: no violation through depth N after Ts ...` - bounded search
  found no violation and the state space was **not** exhausted.

Set `CODEX_LB_TLC_FULL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=0` to remove the budget and run to
exhaustion. A counterexample fails the run either way: the budget only bounds
how long TLC looks, never whether a violation it did find is reported.

Read a `PARTIAL` line as bounded model checking, not proof. The reproducible
evidence in this directory is the negative-control matrix: every weakening
terminates quickly with a mapped counterexample, which is what shows the
invariants have teeth.

### Why `weak-ignore-owner-epoch` maps to two invariants

That weakening changes two things at once: `UseAnchor` accepts a stale-epoch
anchor, and `OwnerLoss` leaves the turn live after clearing `owner[a]` and
advancing `ownerEpoch[a]`. The second is exactly the state the strengthened
`Inv5SingleOwnerCAS` now rejects -- a live turn still mutating under a lease it
no longer holds -- and TLC reaches it at a shallower depth than the bad anchor
use, so it is the violation reported first. `Inv1AnchorCurrent` keeps a
dedicated single-defect control in `weak-ignore-anchor-lineage.cfg`.

## Future Work

The conformance review also recommends modeling separate account reservations,
stream leases, durable bridge claim/renew/release states, client-visible
delivery state, excluded-account failover, stale reservation repair, and
reversible operator drain distinct from committed shutdown. The 2026-08-06
incident adds two more: a process/boot epoch in durable bridge session
ownership so a same-container restart cannot inherit the dead process's rows,
and the deploy-side inequality `stop grace >= committed drain + post-drain
cleanup reserve`. Those dimensions remain outside this tractable core model.
