# Responses traffic parity analysis

Use the traffic parity toolkit to compare a direct Codex request with both
edges of the same request through codex-lb. The analyzer keeps HTTP JSON, HTTP
SSE, and WebSocket as distinct transports while projecting them into a common
Responses turn model.

The normative tooling contract is
[`openspec/specs/compatibility-tooling`](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/tree/main/openspec/specs/compatibility-tooling).
The native cutover is governed by
[`outbound-http-clients`](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/tree/main/openspec/specs/outbound-http-clients),
[`responses-api-compat`](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/tree/main/openspec/specs/responses-api-compat),
and
[`deployment-installation`](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/tree/main/openspec/specs/deployment-installation).

## What the three paths mean

| Path | Traffic | Comparison role |
|---|---|---|
| A′ | Codex client → controlled origin directly | Optional direct-only TLS randomization reference |
| A | Codex client → OpenAI/ChatGPT directly | Optional structural baseline from a separate invocation |
| B | Codex client → codex-lb | Client-visible side of the same proxied invocation |
| C | codex-lb → OpenAI/ChatGPT | Upstream side of the Path B invocation |

Paths B and C are the fidelity oracle. Path A is useful context, but generated
text, response ids, token counts, and timing from a separate model invocation
are not expected to match exactly.

The output calls out the transport on every turn. A B-side SSE stream and a
C-side WebSocket can therefore be compared semantically without pretending
that their framing is identical.

## Safety and storage

The addon always redacts authorization, API-key, cookie, and proxy credential
headers. Its default `metadata` body mode replaces prompt text, generated text,
tool arguments/output, and encrypted content with deterministic SHA-256 and
byte-length metadata. This preserves same-run equality checks without storing
the raw value.

Codex session/thread identifiers and `x-codex-turn-metadata` are also hashed in
metadata mode because those headers can contain workspace and repository
details even when they contain no credential.

For request fields that codex-lb legitimately rewrites, the addon also records
an adapter-aware semantic projection before discarding raw text. This lets
metadata mode compare joined instructions, normalized multimodal parts, and
assistant/tool message conversions while still treating role, item type, tool
name, and call/continuity identifiers as material.

!!! warning

    A capture still contains request structure, sizes, protocol enums, and
    equality fingerprints for values such as models and tool names. Treat it
    as sensitive diagnostic data. Use
    `capture_body_mode=full` only when the metadata capture cannot explain a
    difference.

Raw captures can grow quickly. Keep them outside the repository, for example:

```bash
RUN_DIR=/mnt/scratch/bench/codex-traffic-parity/$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"
umask 077
openssl rand 32 > "$RUN_DIR/source-observer.key"
```

`/mnt/scratch` is not backed up; move only a sanitized, curated result that is
worth retaining to the appropriate durable storage tier.

## Start a capture

The addon is an optional mitmproxy tool and is not part of the codex-lb runtime
dependencies:

```bash
uvx --from mitmproxy mitmdump \
  -s scripts/traffic_analysis/mitmproxy_addon.py \
  --set capture_output="$RUN_DIR/path_c.jsonl" \
  --set capture_body_mode=metadata \
  --set capture_observer_id="$RUN_DIR" \
  --set capture_observer_role=intercept \
  --set capture_source_hmac_key_file="$RUN_DIR/source-observer.key" \
  -p 18081
```

Use the same `capture_observer_id` for Path A and Path C only when those
captures represent the same observation boundary. Use the same HMAC key for the
A/C pair, never retain it with the evidence, and rotate it after the comparison.
The observer id is stored only as a SHA-256 digest. The default `intercept` role
proves which HMAC-digested source host
the capture proxy saw; it does not prove which public source IP OpenAI saw.
Use `capture_observer_role=origin` only when this addon is running at an actual
controlled origin boundary. The raw source host and source port are never
written.

### Controlled origin source probe

The repository includes a deterministic test origin for proving the public
source address seen at a socket boundary. It supports model discovery,
Responses HTTP JSON/SSE, and multiple Responses turns on one WebSocket. It
does not call OpenAI, validate credentials, or copy request content into its
responses.

Run the fixture on loopback at the controlled origin host:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.origin_fixture \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 19090
```

The launcher rejects a non-loopback bind unless `--allow-public-bind` is
explicitly supplied. The recommended topology keeps the fixture private and
exposes only a TLS reverse-capture process:

```text
Codex or codex-lb ── TLS/HTTP/WS ──> public reverse capture ── HTTP ──> 127.0.0.1:19090
```

On the controlled origin, use a real DNS name and a certificate PEM containing
the certificate chain and private key. Bind the public listener only after its
host firewall allows the intended test sources. To attest ASN, obtain a
MaxMind-compatible ASN MMDB through the database provider's normal licensed
process and place it outside the repository. The addon never downloads or
updates a database:

```bash
PROBE_HOST=probe.example
PROBE_CERT=/secure/probe.example.pem
OBSERVER_ID=codex-origin-probe-2026-08-28
SOURCE_HMAC_KEY=/secure/codex-source-observer.key
ASN_DB=/secure/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb

uvx --with maxminddb --from mitmproxy mitmdump \
  --mode reverse:http://127.0.0.1:19090 \
  --listen-host 0.0.0.0 \
  --listen-port 443 \
  --certs "$PROBE_HOST=$PROBE_CERT" \
  -s scripts/traffic_analysis/mitmproxy_addon.py \
  --set capture_output="$RUN_DIR/path_a-origin.jsonl" \
  --set capture_body_mode=metadata \
  --set capture_observer_id="$OBSERVER_ID" \
  --set capture_observer_role=origin \
  --set capture_source_hmac_key_file="$SOURCE_HMAC_KEY" \
  --set capture_asn_mmdb="$ASN_DB"
```

Collect Path A, stop the public listener, restart it with
`capture_output="$RUN_DIR/path_c-origin.jsonl"`, and collect Path C using the
same hostname and observer id. Point direct Codex at
`https://probe.example/v1`; point an isolated codex-lb instance at
`CODEX_LB_UPSTREAM_BASE_URL=https://probe.example/backend-api`. Capture Path B
normally while invoking the isolated instance.

For Path A, a provider with a disposable token avoids sending the user's
OpenAI login to the probe:

```toml
[model_providers.origin-probe]
name = "OpenAI"
base_url = "https://probe.example/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
env_key = "ORIGIN_PROBE_TOKEN"
supports_websockets = true
requires_openai_auth = false
```

Run both direct lanes because Codex selects them from provider capability:

```bash
ORIGIN_PROBE_TOKEN=non-secret-probe-token codex exec --ephemeral \
  -c 'model_provider="origin-probe"' \
  -m gpt-5.6-luna \
  'Return exactly ORIGIN_PROBE_OK.'

# Repeat with supports_websockets=false for the HTTP/SSE lane.
```

Codex 0.150.1 zstd-compresses its HTTP/SSE request body. The fixture decodes
that request before JSON parsing and applies its 1 MiB bound separately to the
encoded and decoded bodies. Malformed zstd and other content encodings are
rejected as client errors.

Use a disposable direct-provider token rather than a real OpenAI key wherever
the Codex provider configuration permits it. codex-lb still sends its selected
account authorization to its configured upstream, so use an isolated
short-lived test account and a controlled host you trust. Metadata capture
redacts the authorization value, but the TLS endpoint necessarily receives
it. Remove the public listener and private key from the probe host after the
run.

The origin addon derives source evidence from the accepted client socket. It
does not trust `Forwarded`, `X-Forwarded-For`, or similar request headers. A
matching `origin` observation therefore proves equal public source addresses
at this controlled boundary. When `capture_asn_mmdb` is configured, the record
also contains the numeric ASN, a SHA-256 digest of its organization, and the
database digest/build metadata. It never contains the raw source address or
organization name. ASN parity is comparable only when A and C use the same
observer and exact database digest; it does not guarantee that a different
destination uses the same policy route.

### Capture a Codex request body for the parity fixtures

The fixture corpus in `tests/fixtures/codex_bodies` records real Codex request
bodies as shape. Capturing one needs no ChatGPT credentials, no upstream contact
and no quota — it is a different lane from the parity capture above, because the
body is recorded *in the origin* rather than at a TLS boundary:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.codex_body_capture \
  --model gpt-5.5 --model gpt-5.6-sol --transport http \
  --out /mnt/scratch/tmp/codex-body-capture-$(date -u +%Y%m%d)
```

The script re-executes itself inside an unprivileged network namespace
(`unshare --map-root-user --net`) and brings up loopback only, so external
egress is kernel-impossible rather than merely unconfigured. It then *verifies*
that: before capturing anything it asks the kernel which interfaces the
namespace has (`socket.if_nameindex`, which is namespace-aware — `/sys/class/net`
is not) and refuses if anything but loopback is reachable. The manifest records
the interface list it observed, so `network_isolation` is evidence rather than a
restatement of the flags the run was given. Inside it, an
in-process origin serves the operator-pinned `/models` catalog and a
deterministic Responses lifecycle, and `codex exec` runs against it with a
throwaway `CODEX_HOME`, a provider declaring `requires_openai_auth = false`,
and a disposable `env_key` token. The origin persists the decoded request bytes
itself, reusing `origin_fixture.decode_request_body` for the zstd request
encoding, so no mitmproxy addon, TLS endpoint or `capture_body_mode` is
involved.

The **capture** command needs `uv run`, like the origin fixture above: its
in-process origin imports FastAPI, uvicorn and `zstandard` from the project
environment, and a bare system interpreter fails at import — on many hosts
`python` is not a command at all. The rebuild and the privacy scan are
stdlib-only and run on any Python 3.11+; they are written with `uv run` below for
consistency with the rest of this document. None of the three needs codex-lb
*configured*: they read no settings and touch no database.

`--transport websocket` sets `supports_websockets = true` on the generated
provider and the origin serves both transports, because the configuration only
*offers* websockets — the client decides. On 0.154.0 the websocket lane opens
with a `generate: false` prewarm frame and only then sends the turn (carrying
`previous_response_id` for the primed response), so the capture keeps the frame
that carries the transcript as the body and writes the prewarm to a separate
`prewarm-*.json`. Keeping both matters: on the Responses-Lite lane the turn
frame is ~8 KB with no `additional_tools` item at all, because the tool bundle
travelled in the prewarm. The artifact name, the run record and the manifest are
all keyed by the transport the body *arrived* on, so a run that fell back to HTTP
is never reported as a websocket capture. A websocket body is persisted
verbatim, frame envelope included; the sanitiser removes the envelope on the way
to a fixture.

The catalog must be pinned to a file. The Codex model manager caches `/models`
for 300 s and invalidates the cache on a `client_version` mismatch, so a run
with a newer CLI always refetches from whatever base URL the provider names.
`--catalog` therefore defaults to the committed reference catalog in
[`scripts/traffic_analysis/catalogs/`](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/tree/main/scripts/traffic_analysis/catalogs/README.md),
the one that produced the fixture corpus: its SHA-256 is the `catalog_sha256`
those provenance entries record, and the corpus gate pins the two together, so
any operator can reproduce a capture and verify the recorded digest. To capture
a different model set, pass a Codex `/models` response — the shape Codex itself
caches as `$CODEX_HOME/models_cache.json`, an object with a `models` array whose
entries the client deserialises strictly — and record its digest.

The catalog does not fully determine the body: 0.154.0 layers bundled
`model_info` overrides on top of the served catalog (a row saying
`supports_search_tool: false` still produces a body with `web_search` and
`tool_search` declarations), which is why the CLI version is the primary
provenance key.

Every refusal fires before any process starts: an `--out` inside the repository
or under a temporary filesystem, an exported `CODEX_HOME` holding an
`auth.json`, a shell
carrying `CODEX_LB_*` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` /
`CHATGPT_BASE_URL` / `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `CODEX_API_BASE_URL` /
`CODEX_SESSION_ID`, a shell carrying any outbound proxy variable
(`HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` / `WS_PROXY` / `WSS_PROXY` /
`SOCKS_PROXY` / `FTP_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY`, either spelling), a non-loopback
origin, and a repository config file or `.env` passed as the catalog.
`--no-network-namespace` exists for hosts without `unshare` and requires the
explicit `--i-accept-network-egress` companion. The isolation refusal is the one
exception to "before any process starts", and necessarily so: it can only be
made *inside* the namespace, so it fires in the re-executed child — still before
the capture directory, the origin or `codex` exist.

The proxy refusal is not tidiness. The Codex client routes even its
`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1` POST through `HTTP_PROXY` and does not bypass
loopback: a run in a proxied shell captures nothing, and a run that also passed
`--no-network-namespace` would deliver the whole request body — cwd, `AGENTS.md`
text, skills inventory, prompt — to whatever host the variable names.

Then rebuild the body into a fixture, read it, and only then put it in the
corpus:

```bash
# 1. rebuild to a scratch path
uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.codex_body_sanitize \
  --in  <capture-dir>/body-gpt-5.5-http-<stamp>.json \
  --out <capture-dir>/fixture.json \
  --headers-in  <capture-dir>/headers-gpt-5.5-http-<stamp>.json \
  --headers-out <capture-dir>/sanitised-headers.json \
  --emit-redactions <capture-dir>/redactions.json

# 2. read <capture-dir>/fixture.json, then copy it in
uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.codex_body_sanitize \
  --in  <capture-dir>/fixture.json \
  --out tests/fixtures/codex_bodies/<name>.json \
  --i-have-read-the-sanitised-body

uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.fixture_privacy_scan \
  --root tests/fixtures/codex_bodies --strict
```

The privacy scan runs as written on a pristine checkout, with no flags beyond
the corpus root: the bodies allowed to keep bare Codex telemetry key names are
read from `provenance.json` (`carries_client_telemetry`) and printed.
`--allow-telemetry-keys` remains for a tree that has no provenance file. Also
scan the raw capture directory, but *without* `--strict`: the raw body, header
sidecar and manifest report findings by construction, which is the reminder to
delete them rather than a gate.

#### The fixture is rebuilt, not scrubbed

`codex_body_sanitize` constructs the fixture from a structural allowlist. Every
node of the captured body is matched against a rule, and a rule either
**preserves** a closed domain the portability decision reads — an object key, a
`type`/`role`/`status`/`effort`/`verbosity` discriminator, a JSON Schema
keyword, a boolean, a bounded number, a model slug in slug shape, one of Codex's
own tool names — or **synthesises** the value outright. Everything else is
synthesised: `instructions`, message content text, a `function_call`'s
`arguments`, a `function_call_output`'s `output`, a tool `description`, a JSON
Schema property name, an `enum` value, a `metadata` key, a URL, every
identifier. One exception, and it is in the code as a literal list: the eight
account-scoped reference property names `replay_safety` keys on (`file_id`,
`file_ids`, `container_id`, `vector_store_id`, `vector_store_ids`,
`encrypted_content`, `image_url`, `file_url`) keep their names in a schema's
`properties` and `required`, because renaming one moves the verdict under a
`tool_search` declaration. The substitute is derived from the value's JSON path, so two
operators rebuilding one capture produce one file. A replaced string leaves
behind only: whether it was blank; for a URL, its scheme, which is what decides
account-neutrality; for an identifier, which other identifiers it equalled; and
for a `metadata` key or a JSON Schema property name, its alphabetical rank among
its siblings, because the numbering follows sorted order so that a rebuild of a
rebuild is byte-identical. A node no rule
describes stops the run and names the path; nothing is dropped silently, because
a missing key changes the key set the replay predicate validates.

Item ids and `call_id`s are replaced with placeholders that stay referentially
consistent, so a call and its output still pair; absence is preserved and no key
is ever added, because a real Responses-Lite body has no `instructions`, `tools`
or `stream_options` and the portability view declines unknown top-level fields.
The rebuild is idempotent, and the gate asserts the recorded portability verdict
is identical before and after it.

This replaced a denylist that kept the captured text and rewrote the substrings
a set of regexes recognised. It was bypassed twice; the second time measurably.
A `function_call_output` carrying
`PATH=/usr/local/bin:/home/jane/.local/bin` was rewritten to
`PATH=/workspace/repo:/home/jane/.local/bin`, because the path pattern's
lookbehind excluded a path sitting immediately after `:` — and the rewrite
deleted the *only* substring the privacy scan could see, so the scan then
reported a clean body with the operator's home directory in it. Neither failure
mode has anywhere to happen now. Nothing rewrites a captured string, and a
captured string reaches the fixture only where a rule names the closed domain it
came from — object keys, discriminators, JSON Schema keywords, booleans,
bounded numbers, a model slug in slug shape, Codex's own tool names, and the
residue named above. Everything else is constructed.

Numbers are bounded rather than merely preserved, because Python integers have
no width and a JSON double carries 53 bits of mantissa: an unbounded
`max_output_tokens`, `top_p` or JSON Schema `default` is an unbounded channel
that no walk over *strings* can see. A preserved number must satisfy
`|v| <= 2^31` with at most four decimal places, and every number inside a tool's
schema is replaced with `0` — none of them is read by the portability decision.
The model slug is the one operator-chosen token kept verbatim, and because a
shape is not a closed domain the gate pins it twice: against the slug
`provenance.json` records, and against the committed reference catalog.

The cost is that the committed fixture is no longer readable as a transcript: it
carries the shape of a real request and none of its prose. Nothing in the gate
reads the prose. `tests/fixtures/codex_bodies/README.md` records what Codex
actually sends, and says which of those facts the fixture no longer shows.

The walk that enforces all of this (`surviving_captured_strings`) is a detector,
not a proof: it reads strings only, and only tokens of three characters or more
in the ASCII path/identifier alphabet. It runs in the CLI before a write and in
the corpus gate over the committed bodies; `sanitize_body` itself does not run
it, so a programmatic caller has to ask.

#### The privacy scan is a second net

`fixture_privacy_scan` adds a residual pass on top of `privacy_scan`'s
credential shapes, which passes a tree full of live UUIDs and workspace paths on
its own: a live UUID, a string-valued telemetry key, an email address, an
absolute path, an account or host name, an `<environment_context>` tag or
`<skills_instructions>` inventory whose value is not the corpus placeholder.

It is pattern matching over bytes, and it is incomplete by construction — an
operator path that arrives `\uXXXX`-escaped or base64-wrapped is invisible to
it, both measured. It is worth running because it catches a hand-edited fixture
and a body that never went through the rebuild, not because it clears one. Its
ordering matters too: the sanitiser scans the **captured** body as well as the
rebuilt one, and a kind present in the capture and absent afterwards is reported
as evidence about the rebuild rather than as a pass — which is precisely what
the previous version got wrong.

Nothing in either tool is taken from the machine it runs on, so a capture
rebuilds to the same fixture and a corpus reaches the same verdict on every host.

#### The boundary is human diff review

No tool here can tell you a fixture is the one you meant to commit. Writing into
`tests/fixtures/codex_bodies/` therefore requires
`--i-have-read-the-sanitised-body`, and the command refuses without it. That
flag, and the reading it stands for, is the boundary; the allowlist is what
makes the reading short enough to be real.

Never commit a `headers-*.json`: it holds the `authorization` line even when
the token was disposable, and the header sidecar is still a denylist — it is an
operator aid, never a committed artifact. Delete the raw capture directory in
the same session.

The corpus contract, the per-fixture provenance and the recorded verdicts are
documented in
[`tests/fixtures/codex_bodies/README.md`](https://github.com/Soju06/codex-lb/tree/main/tests/fixtures/codex_bodies/README.md),
and gated by `tests/unit/test_codex_body_fixtures.py`.

### Controlled failure-path matrix

The fixture defaults to the normal success path. To compare failure behavior,
restart it with exactly one operator-selected scenario; requests cannot select
or override the scenario:

```bash
python scripts/traffic_analysis/origin_fixture.py \
  --failure-scenario http_429 \
  --failure-delay-seconds 30
```

Use the same scenario for the direct Codex path and the codex-lb path:

| Scenario | Transport | Controlled outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `http_429` | HTTP/SSE | JSON `429` with a bounded `Retry-After` hint |
| `http_503` | HTTP/SSE | JSON `503` |
| `http_timeout` | HTTP/SSE | Operator-configured bounded response delay |
| `sse_incomplete` | SSE | `response.created`, then EOF without a terminal event |
| `websocket_reject` | WebSocket | Reject before accepting the turn |
| `websocket_incomplete` | WebSocket | `response.created`, then close with code `1011` |

The comparison output records the same HTTP status, normalized retry hint,
terminal class, completeness, incomplete reason, and bounded network-error
category in two views. `failure_path_a_vs_b` shows direct Codex versus the
client-visible codex-lb outcome, including attempt counts and the final outcome;
`failure_path_b_vs_c` shows the same-run LB ingress/egress translation. Both
views label exact matches, failure translations, and success/failure mismatches.
They remain explanatory: incomplete or malformed turns still fail the strict
gate, and a differing B/C `Retry-After` value is a hard mismatch.

After collecting all seven scenarios (including `success`) beneath one root,
gate the bounded end-to-end profile separately from raw B/C framing:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.failure_matrix \
  --root "$FAILURE_RUN" \
  --output "$FAILURE_RUN/failure-matrix.md" \
  --json-output "$FAILURE_RUN/failure-matrix.json" \
  --strict
```

The baseline contains attempt counts, statuses, retry hints, outcome classes,
and relations only. Timeout and incomplete scenarios may have an expected raw
B/C strict failure while still passing the A/B client-visible recovery gate.

On first use mitmproxy creates a local CA under `~/.mitmproxy`. Only install or
trust that CA in the test process or disposable test environment.

### Path C: codex-lb to upstream

Run the Path C proxy on port `18081`, then start codex-lb with its upstream
proxy variables pointing at it:

```bash
https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:18081 \
wss_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:18081 \
SSL_CERT_FILE="$HOME/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem" \
uv run fastapi run app/main.py --port 2455
```

The upstream stream transport is a dashboard setting (Settings → Routing →
Upstream stream transport). `auto` exercises the normal transport decision. Set
the transport to `http` or `websocket` in the dashboard for a controlled lane,
then run both lanes when investigating a transport-specific regression. If the account has an explicit upstream proxy
route, route it through the capture proxy as well; explicit account routing can
otherwise bypass environment proxies.

### Path B: client to codex-lb

Use mitmproxy reverse mode so localhost proxy bypass rules cannot skip the
capture:

```bash
uvx --from mitmproxy mitmdump \
  --mode reverse:http://127.0.0.1:2455 \
  -s scripts/traffic_analysis/mitmproxy_addon.py \
  --set capture_output="$RUN_DIR/path_b.jsonl" \
  --set capture_body_mode=metadata \
  -p 18082
```

Point the test Codex provider at the reverse proxy instead of codex-lb
directly:

```toml
[model_providers.codex-lb-capture]
name = "openai"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:18082/backend-api/codex"
wire_api = "responses"
env_key = "CODEX_LB_API_KEY"
supports_websockets = true
requires_openai_auth = true
```

Run one deterministic scenario. Reusing the same prompt, tool declarations,
reasoning effort, and service tier makes request transformations easier to
classify. Paths B and C are collected simultaneously from this run.

### Path A: optional direct baseline

Start another regular capture on port `18080` with output `path_a.jsonl`, then
run the same scenario with the ordinary direct Codex provider and the test
process's `https_proxy`/`wss_proxy` set to that port. This is a separate model
invocation; use it to establish protocol shape, not byte-for-byte output
identity.

### Path A′: TLS randomization reference

For a statistically meaningful ClientHello comparison, make a second direct
capture in `path_a_reference.jsonl`. Collect 50–100 independent TLS
connections for each transport under test in A′, A, and C. Repeated HTTP/2
requests or WebSocket frames on one connection count as one sample because the
analyzer deduplicates `client_hello_sha256`. Use fresh client/helper processes
or a controlled origin that closes each connection so every sample performs a
new handshake.

Keep HTTP JSON, HTTP SSE, and WebSocket runs separate. The analyzer reports
each transport independently and returns `N/A`, never PASS, when any cohort has
fewer than 20 independent ClientHellos. `--tls-min-samples` may raise this
floor for a stricter experiment; lowering it is intended only for fixture
smoke tests.

## Analyze captures

Generate a machine-readable comparison:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.compare \
  --path-a-reference "$RUN_DIR/path_a_reference.jsonl" \
  --path-a "$RUN_DIR/path_a.jsonl" \
  --path-b "$RUN_DIR/path_b.jsonl" \
  --path-c "$RUN_DIR/path_c.jsonl" \
  --json-output "$RUN_DIR/comparison.json"
```

Add `--strict` when a hard B/C mismatch should return a nonzero exit status.
Transport changes are reported but do not fail solely because the two edges
use different framing.

Generate the Markdown investigation report:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.generate_report \
  --path-a-reference "$RUN_DIR/path_a_reference.jsonl" \
  --path-a "$RUN_DIR/path_a.jsonl" \
  --path-b "$RUN_DIR/path_b.jsonl" \
  --path-c "$RUN_DIR/path_c.jsonl" \
  --output "$RUN_DIR/report.md"
```

Review at least:

- per-turn B/C transport and any transition;
- end-to-end A/B failure attempts and final outcome;
- B/C `Retry-After` preservation on HTTP rejections;
- missing or malformed turns and orphan WebSocket frames;
- model, reasoning, service-tier, tool, and continuity-field transformations;
- ordered material Responses lifecycle events and terminal class;
- function-call identity/correlation and terminal usage details;
- raw differences classified as expected transport wrappers versus hard
  semantic mismatches.

### Composite regression gate

After collecting the semantic, repeated TLS, and raw HTTP/2 evidence families,
combine them into one fail-closed verdict:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.composite_gate \
  --semantic-path-a "$SEMANTIC_RUN/path_a.jsonl" \
  --semantic-path-b "$SEMANTIC_RUN/path_b.jsonl" \
  --semantic-path-c "$SEMANTIC_RUN/path_c.jsonl" \
  --tls-path-a-reference "$TLS_RUN/path_a_reference.jsonl" \
  --tls-path-a "$TLS_RUN/path_a.jsonl" \

The defaults require B/C HTTP SSE and WebSocket semantic coverage, all three
HTTP JSON/SSE/WebSocket TLS cohorts with at least 20 independent ClientHellos,
and every stable A′/A plus A/C raw HTTP/2 dimension. Use repeated
`--require-semantic-transport` or `--require-tls-transport` flags only when an
experiment has an explicitly narrower contract. A required but absent,
malformed, or undersampled lane fails instead of becoming `N/A` or an implicit
pass.

The aggregate outputs contain compact verdicts and SHA-256/byte-count
attestations for the source files. They do not copy capture bodies, header
values, HPACK fragments, WebSocket payloads, or per-sample ClientHello hashes.
HTTP duration and WebSocket flow-span percentiles are diagnostic only and do
not participate in strict parity because the compared processes and model
invocations have independent scheduling.

### Version and weekly fast canary

This host installs a user timer that checks the installed Codex version daily.
It runs the controlled raw HTTP/2 suite and all seven failure scenarios when
the version changes or seven days have elapsed since the last successful run:

```bash
systemctl --user status codex-traffic-parity-canary.timer
journalctl --user -u codex-traffic-parity-canary.service -n 100

# Check whether work is due without changing state.
uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.canary_runner \
  --config /home/ubuntu/work/codex-lb/traffic-parity-canary/config.json \
  --dry-run

# Operator-forced run through the same lock and success contract.
uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.canary_runner \
  --config /home/ubuntu/work/codex-lb/traffic-parity-canary/config.json \
  --force
```

The timer unit is `codex-traffic-parity-canary.timer`; its host-local config,
state, and lock live under
`/home/ubuntu/work/codex-lb/traffic-parity-canary/`. The config invokes the
repository-owned `scripts.traffic_analysis.fast_canary_suite` module with
explicit repo, runner, auth, and approved scratch paths; it contains no suite
logic. Each run receives a new directory under
`/mnt/scratch/bench/codex-traffic-parity/`. State advances only after the gates
pass, database/key/log cleanup completes, and the retained tree passes the
credential-shape privacy scan. Overlap, command timeout, a missing scenario,
or invalid result leaves the previous success unchanged.

Before either runner starts, the suite stamps the isolated `auth.json`'s
recorded refresh time to the current instant — every key the account importer
accepts (`lastRefreshAt`, `last_refresh`), so no stale alias outranks the stamp
— with mode 600 preserved and tokens untouched. An imported
account inherits that timestamp, and codex-lb proactively exchanges a refresh
token once the account is older than the fixed eight-day
`TOKEN_REFRESH_INTERVAL_DAYS` window (`app/core/auth/refresh.py`). Without the
stamp, a run started with a week-old isolated credential would exchange that
real, single-use refresh token against `https://auth.openai.com` — the OAuth
host is a protocol constant, so redirecting `CODEX_LB_UPSTREAM_BASE_URL` at the
fixture does not cover it — rotating the credential into a database the suite
deletes on cleanup and leaving every later run with a dead file. The stamp
replaces the former `CODEX_LB_TOKEN_REFRESH_INTERVAL_DAYS=365` pin, which is a
removed setting; delete that line from host-local runner scripts to silence its
startup WARN.

The scheduled result is labelled `fast_canary`. It does not include the
independently sampled HTTP JSON/SSE/WebSocket ClientHello cohorts and therefore
must not be reported as a full composite or TLS attestation. Run the composite
gate with at least 20 ClientHellos per TLS cohort for a release, monthly check,
or TLS-stack change.

### Server-observable A↔C profile

When Path A is present, the report also keeps these dimensions independent:

- HTTP version and negotiated ALPN;
- negotiated TLS version/cipher and ClientHello metadata, including offered
  cipher suites, extensions, groups, key shares, signature algorithms, and the
  JA3 digest;
- Codex identity headers;
- decoded request header-name order, duplicate occurrences, and original
  casing, without additional header values;
- SSE framing observations;
- WebSocket handshake and extension negotiation.
- source-host equality at a common attested capture observer, when configured.
- ASN number/organization equality under the same offline database provenance,
  when configured.

This section is informational and deliberately does not turn matching headers
into a claim of full traffic equivalence. Missing observer attestation is shown
as `N/A`, not a match. An `intercept` observer match covers only that capture
boundary; public source IP and ASN evidence require a controlled `origin`
observation, and ASN additionally requires the same offline database digest.

When A′ is supplied, the report also compares repeated TLS samples per
transport. Cipher suites, extension sets and lengths, groups, key shares,
signature algorithms, ALPN, and negotiated TLS fields must match exactly after
normalizing standard GREASE values and excluding the order-constrained PSK
extension. Extension serialization order is summarized as pairwise precedence
probabilities and mean binary entropy. A↔C passes the order check only when its
mean pairwise distance is within the larger of the observed A′↔A distance and
a deterministic direct-only bootstrap 95% limit. Raw JA3 and ClientHello
hashes remain informational.

### Raw HTTP/2 SETTINGS and header-block profile

Use the separate controlled HTTP/2 origin when decoded HTTP captures are not
enough. It observes client bytes after TLS termination and before hyper-h2
decoding. The JSONL records contain only the connection preface result, frame
type/flags/stream id/payload length, ordered initial SETTINGS, WINDOW_UPDATE
increments, stream reuse, decoded header names, and opaque SHA-256/length
metadata for HEADERS and CONTINUATION payloads. Header values, HPACK bytes,
DATA bytes, request bodies, source addresses, and TLS secrets are never stored.

Create or provision a short-lived certificate outside the repository. For a
loopback-only smoke run, a disposable self-signed certificate is sufficient:

```bash
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR/tls"
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 1 \
  -subj '/CN=localhost' \
  -keyout "$RUN_DIR/tls/observer.key" \
  -out "$RUN_DIR/tls/observer.crt"

uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.h2_observer \
  --cert "$RUN_DIR/tls/observer.crt" \
  --key "$RUN_DIR/tls/observer.key" \
  --output "$RUN_DIR/path_a-h2.jsonl"
```

The listener defaults to `127.0.0.1:19443`, accepts only ALPN `h2`, and rejects
a non-loopback bind unless `--allow-public-bind` is present. For a remote
controlled origin, use a trusted DNS certificate, restrict the host firewall
to the intended test sources, and delete the short-lived private key after the
run. The tool does not generate or persist certificate material itself.

Point the direct Codex provider at this origin and collect the HTTP lane. Stop
the listener, restart it with `--output "$RUN_DIR/path_c-h2.jsonl"`, and point
the isolated codex-lb upstream at the same origin. Use a disposable probe token
because a TLS endpoint necessarily receives credentials even though its
capture record omits their values. An optional second direct run supplies A′:

```bash
uv run python -m scripts.traffic_analysis.http2_profile \
  --path-a-reference "$RUN_DIR/path_a-reference-h2.jsonl" \
  --path-a "$RUN_DIR/path_a-h2.jsonl" \
  --path-c "$RUN_DIR/path_c-h2.jsonl" \
  --output "$RUN_DIR/http2-profile.md" \
  --json-output "$RUN_DIR/http2-profile.json" \
  --strict
```

The strict A↔C gates are ordered initial SETTINGS, pre-request connection
control shape, decoded header-name order/casing, normalized request DATA
segmentation, stream ids, and connection reuse. A′↔A is direct-client variance
context for the standalone report and a required repeatability gate in the
composite report. Missing evidence is `N/A` in the standalone report and a
failure when the composite gate requires it.
HPACK fragment lengths and digests are informational only: equality does not
prove equal decoded values or dynamic-table history, and a difference does not
by itself prove a semantic mismatch.

DATA segmentation compares `max` versus `partial` frame classes and ordered
END_STREAM/PADDED flags using the advertised maximum frame size. It deliberately
does not compare DATA bytes or the variable partial-tail length, so independent
turn body sizes do not manufacture a mismatch while a different chunking policy
still does.

The connection-control projection excludes client SETTINGS ACK frames. An ACK
reacts to the controlled origin's server SETTINGS and can cross the first
HEADERS boundary as server scheduling changes; it is not a client-selected
startup profile. Initial non-ACK SETTINGS and WINDOW_UPDATE frames remain exact
gates.

## Capture modes

| Mode | Body handling | Intended use |
|---|---|---|
| `metadata` | Sensitive strings become digest + byte length | Default parity investigation |
| `full` | Raw JSON/SSE/WebSocket bodies retained; headers still redacted | Short-lived deep debugging |
| `none` | Body/frame payloads omitted | Header, status, route, and timing checks |

`none` captures are useful for manual transport diagnostics, but a B/C strict
comparison fails with `insufficient_capture_body` because it cannot prove
request, event payload, usage, or tool-call fidelity.

The capture addon deliberately buffers an HTTP SSE response until mitmproxy's
response hook. It compares event semantics, not TCP read sizes or HTTP chunk
boundaries. Its TLS ClientHello hook records a credential-free fingerprint and
hash, but never stores the raw handshake. Extension order can be randomized by
the client, so use the A′/A/C repeated-sample analysis instead of treating one
JA3 value as a stable identity. The controlled raw HTTP/2 origin covers
SETTINGS, frame shape, and opaque header-block fragments. Packet/raw-socket
tooling is still required for exact TLS record boundaries, TCP behavior, and
physical chunk timing.

Header sequence evidence describes the decoded field names presented by the
HTTP stack. It can reveal order, duplicate, or casing differences, but it does
not expose header values beyond the separately redacted header map and cannot
prove HPACK representation, dynamic-table state, or HTTP/2 SETTINGS/frame
parity.

## Native Codex egress

Official Linux containers include the locked `codex-lb-native-egress` helper.
When present, direct and account-routed model discovery, Responses HTTP/SSE,
and Responses or Live WebSockets use the pinned Codex-family Rust stack.
WebSockets use the OpenAI Codex 0.150.1 tungstenite fork revisions, default
`permessage-deflate`, native TLS roots, and transport-owned ping/pong liveness.
Missing-helper detection is safe and zero-configuration; source and wheel
installations retain the Python transports. A Responses POST, WebSocket
handshake, or frame is never replayed through Python after an ambiguous native
failure.

For account routes, Python still owns account selection, ordered endpoint
fallback, route metadata, and health classification. It passes one concrete
HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5, or SOCKS5H endpoint to the helper for each attempt. Only a
confirmed pre-dispatch connection failure can gain the existing safe endpoint
fallback; TLS verification and ambiguous delivery remain non-replayable.

Each codex-lb worker owns one persistent helper. Compatible direct and routed
HTTP requests share reqwest pools partitioned by effective proxy and connect
timeout, and WebSockets are independently multiplexed in that process. Workers
do not share pools with each other. The native HTTP pool uses the maintained
Codex initial HTTP/2 SETTINGS and connection-window profile, and native
Responses/model-discovery header names retain the maintained direct order.
Each helper generation negotiates a versioned capability contract before the
first request. A present but incompatible binary fails before dispatch instead
of silently falling back to Python.
Source IP/ASN (which follows the selected proxy), HPACK history, TCP behavior,
TLS extension order, and request/frame timing remain separately observable
dimensions. Decoded header order and casing are captured and compared, but
their compressed wire representation remains informational.
