## Why

When upstream resets a quota window earlier than the deadline a 429 persisted,
codex-lb keeps the account benched until that stale deadline. The persisted
`reset_at` is a prediction made at block time; an upstream-side early or
compensatory reset silently invalidates it, and nothing re-evaluates it.

A strict reset-confirmed exception for exactly this situation already exists,
but it is scoped to Free accounts and to the monthly window. A paid account
blocked on its 5h or 7d window has no path out, even while background usage
refresh is recording, every refresh interval, that the window the deadline came
from has rolled and reports available quota. Observed in production on a Pro
fleet: an upstream-wide early 7d reset left three accounts benched with
deadlines three to four days out, each one accumulating post-reset `0%` samples
that carried a brand-new window deadline, and the only remedy was a manual
reactivate. Issue #676 reported the same shape on Plus.

The plan check was never the safety property. What binds evidence to a block is
the baseline deadline match: a deadline derived from a Retry-After hint or a
model-scoped throttle matches no quota window's reset metadata, and a reset in
an unrelated window does not match this block's deadline. Free-plan scoping was
a conservative proxy for that binding because a Free account has exactly one
quota window and therefore no window ambiguity to resolve.

## What Changes

- Resolve the reset-evidence anchor by searching every quota-window slot
  (primary, secondary, monthly) for a post-block transition whose baseline
  deadline matches the account's persisted `reset_at`, instead of only the
  monthly slot for Free accounts. The account's plan no longer gates the
  exception.
- Require the whole evidence chain (baseline, before, after, and the latest
  sample) to come from the one window the anchor identified, so a reset in an
  unrelated window cannot release a block.
- Withhold a long-window recovery while the account's own short window is
  exhausted and unelapsed, which is the risk the Free-plan scoping was standing
  in for. The Free primary slot has zero capacity and is excluded; an unknown
  plan capacity is not treated as proof the window is absent. A long window at
  100% deliberately does not withhold recovery: credit-backed quota and
  weekly-shape normalization govern whether it still permits traffic, and if it
  truly is spent upstream re-blocks with a fresh deadline instead of a stale one.
- Keep reset-confirmed warm-up on the monthly slot: evidence resolved from the
  primary or secondary slot is used for recovery only and is not substituted
  into the monthly before/after pair warm-up consumes.
- Add regression coverage at the scheduler path for paid early-window recovery,
  anchor mismatch, and the sibling-exhaustion and elapsed-sibling rules.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

None.

### Modified Capabilities

- `usage-refresh-policy`: Generalize the reset-confirmed recovery exception from
  the Free monthly window to whichever quota window the persisted deadline is
  anchored to, and add the sibling-window exhaustion guard.
- `account-routing`: Restate the cross-replica cooldown exception in terms of
  the anchored blocked window rather than the account's plan.

## Impact

- Affected code: background usage refresh evidence resolution and recoverable
  status reconciliation.
- Affected tests: scheduler recovery unit coverage and the repository-backed
  scheduler scope integration test.
- No API, schema, migration, setting, dependency, dashboard, or deployment
  contract changes.
