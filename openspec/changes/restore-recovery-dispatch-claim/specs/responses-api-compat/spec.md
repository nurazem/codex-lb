## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Fenced one-shot recovery dispatch

The durable recovery journal MUST persist a one-shot replay budget for every
recovery-safe request. The budget MUST be consumed atomically when a replay is
claimed for dispatch, and a caller that proves the replay never reached the
upstream send boundary MUST restore that claim under the same session owner
fence. A replacement session MUST retain or transfer a fenced origin owner
until the claim is rolled back or settled; selecting a replacement or failing
preflight MUST NOT permanently consume an unsent replay.

#### Scenario: Concurrent reconnects consume one replay

- **WHEN** concurrent reconnects observe the same ambiguous operation
- **THEN** exactly one owner atomically claims the persisted replay budget and
  other reconnects fail closed without dispatching a duplicate

#### Scenario: Pre-dispatch replacement failure restores the budget

- **WHEN** a replay claim is made but replacement admission or preflight fails
  before the exact upstream frame is sent
- **THEN** the claim returns to the available state and the fenced origin
  owner is released only after that rollback succeeds

#### Scenario: Successful replacement settles the origin journal

- **WHEN** a replacement session dispatches the claimed replay and receives a
  terminal response event
- **THEN** settlement uses the retained origin owner fence before releasing it
  and the replay budget cannot be claimed again
