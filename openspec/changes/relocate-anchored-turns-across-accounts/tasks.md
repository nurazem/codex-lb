- [x] Resolve the fence-retirement collision. #2366 merged and was reverted by
  #2383, so `claim_unknown_operation_for_recovery` and the
  `expected_recovery_dispatch_count` CAS predicates are back on `main`. Keep the
  dependency recorded so the retirement is not reattempted.
- [ ] Gate every relocation lane on the transport actually having the material
  it needs. `record_operation` has exactly one caller
  (`_service/http_bridge/request_submit.py`), so only bridge turns have a
  durable chain, and the side-effect dedupe is wired only there too. A transport
  without durable material must report an absent transcript and keep today's
  behaviour; a transport without the dedupe contract must not take the fenced
  lane. Add the negative tests for both.
- [ ] New pure module `app/modules/proxy/replay_relocation.py`:
  `RelocationInputs` / `RelocationVerdict` / `decide_relocation`. Decline order:
  downstream-visible output, then ownership facts (`single_account`, file pin,
  turn-state owner, session identity), then evidence, then the source ladder
  (client full resend -> durable transcript -> unanchored), each ending in
  `responses_payload_is_account_neutral_fresh_replay`. Closed vocabulary for
  `decline_reason`. No lenient fallback projection.
- [ ] `app/modules/proxy/replay_safety.py`: add the pure transcript rebuild —
  parent-chain assembly oldest first (the order the repository returns), with each
  turn superseding or appending per the classification above. There is no
  prefix-overlap dedupe. **Delete the content-matching overlap search.** Three rounds of it
  produced three different ways to delete a message the client had just sent,
  because content equality cannot tell a restatement from a coincidence.
  Implement the tail-overlap join: where the client's input matches the tail of
  what the chain walk accumulated, discard that chain tail and append the
  client's input verbatim. Same rule per chain turn as the walk accumulates.
  **Never drop a client item; dropping chain items the client re-supplied is
  free.** Do not classify the client's intent — full resend, delta and rolling
  window are not distinguishable from the request, and every rule that tried
  (`previous_response_id`, model-authored items, structural self-containment)
  was wrong for one of the real shapes. In particular
  `responses_input_items_are_self_contained_fresh_replay` is a safety predicate,
  not a completeness test; using it as one inverts the outcome for the full
  resends Codex actually sends (developer-instruction-led, tool-pair tail).
  Still pass the anchor in so the walk can verify it terminates there.
- [ ] Build the comparison key from a POSITIVE enumeration of what identifies an
  item. Two rounds subtracted a hand-listed set of per-recording fields and each
  was defeated by a field nobody had listed — first `status`, then `phase` and
  `internal_chat_message_metadata_passthrough`. A subtractive list can never be
  finished; a positive one is bounded by what a turn is. **Recurse.** An
  enumeration that stops at the item's top level and serializes a nested value
  whole is the same failure one level down: round 9 identified
  `additional_tools` by the whole `tools` value, so rewording a tool's
  description dispatched the conversation twice. An unreachable structure must
  make the item unidentifiable, not compared raw.
- [ ] Sweep the guard across every item kind the strict predicate admits and
  every nested position, not three kinds and no content-part field. Feed the
  independent checker the same breadth — it currently only ever sees plain text
  messages, so it validates nothing about the other item types the key claims to
  identify.
- [ ] Exercise the transcript caps on the path production uses, not through the
  test file's own rebuild helpers.
- [ ] Bound the item count alongside turns and bytes. Neither existing cap bounds
  items, so the worst legal input is the smallest legal item repeated until the
  byte budget is spent.
- [ ] Compute the overlap on the PROJECTED form of both sides while dispatching
  the client's verbatim items, and compute it in LINEAR time. Comparing
  projected chain items against verbatim client ones makes one allowlisted-field
  difference (an assistant message without `status`) collapse the overlap and
  double the conversation. A nested scan is 6.6 s of blocking CPU on a chain at
  72% of the byte cap and extrapolates to ~16 minutes at the cap, because the
  caps bound turns and bytes but not items.
- [ ] Build the truth-table rows from WIRE shapes, not from the proxy's
  post-projection normal form. Every non-zero-overlap row of the previous round
  used `_replayed_assistant_item`, so the rows that were supposed to prove the
  overlap works proved only that it works on already-normalized input. Include a
  row where the client's input ENDS the conversation rather than extending it —
  every previous row appended a fresh question, and two independent edits
  survive because of it.
- [ ] Bind the join with a truth table over real client shapes, asserting the
  dispatched body item by item: developer-led full resend, tool-pair-tail full
  resend, tool-only history, rolling window of 1 and 2 exchanges, a window from
  the middle of the chain, a coincidental mid-chain match, and a chain whose own
  turns restate. For every row assert both invariants: no client item missing,
  no turn twice.
- [ ] `_service/support.py`: `materialize_relocation(...)` — the only caller of
  `DurableBridgeRepository.get_replayable_transcript`; load failure is treated
  as "no transcript"; emits one structured `relocation_decision` log line.
  Add `_durable_bridge` to `_StreamingServiceProtocol`.
- [ ] Delegate the five existing bespoke implementations to the shared verdict:
  `_service/streaming/retry.py` (`_verified_cross_transport_fresh_replay`,
  `_stream_owner_bound_to`, `_move_verified_fresh_replay_from_owner` and its
  four call sites), `_service/http_bridge/streaming.py`
  (`_VerifiedDurableFullResend._verify`, `classify_durable_full_resend` and the
  replay sites), `_service/websocket/helpers.py`. Leave `_service/compact.py`
  on today's behaviour — it is a separate change.
- [ ] Fenced lane (case ②): claim through
  `claim_unknown_operation_for_recovery` with a bound of one dispatch per
  operation; require zero spooled events, no response id, and an elapsed
  dispatch age within the ambiguity window; arm the side-effect replay-dedupe
  identity on the relocated dispatch; restore the claim via
  `mark_operation_unknown(restore_recovery_dispatch_claim=True)` on
  post-claim/pre-frame failure and `rollback_operation_before_dispatch` when
  nothing was written; on a refused claim terminate through the transport's own
  existing fail-closed outcome (the bridge's `upstream_operation_status_unknown`
  503 with its cooldown hint) without a second dispatch.
- [ ] Unfenced lane (case ①): definitive evidence rolls back rather than claims;
  assert in tests that it never decrements the recovery budget.
- [ ] Constants, not settings: the relocation transcript caps, the ambiguity
  window and the one-shot bound are module constants. Bind the byte cap as a
  WHOLE-TRANSCRIPT bound with a test that fails when it is read per turn, and
  bind which SSE event types count as a settled terminal with a test that fails
  when a failure terminal is admitted — both survived mutation in round 3. Confirm the
  `[settings_fields]` ratchet does not move.
- [ ] New `tests/unit/test_replay_relocation.py`: the decision table —
  transports x sources x evidence x ownership facts, asserting `movable`,
  `source` and the exact `decline_reason` for every cell.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_replay_safety.py`: parent-chain rebuild; overlap dedupe
  including the single-item overlap and the tail-match form; `response.incomplete`
  without `response.output` falling back to accumulated
  `response.output_item.done`; no terminal marker -> `None`; broken or cyclic
  chain -> `None`; scalar input -> `None`; unsettled tool call -> `None`;
  non-portable tool -> `None`.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_proxy_http_bridge.py`: ① anchored delta continuation with
  an exhausted owner relocates and dispatches exactly once; ② eventless
  ambiguous failure relocates exactly once and the second attempt terminates
  with `upstream_operation_status_unknown`; ② with a spooled event declines
  **without** consuming the claim; ② past the ambiguity window declines;
  restore the concurrent-reconnect single-claim test the #2336 archive deleted;
  preflight failure after the claim refunds the budget.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_bridge_ring_lifecycle.py`: the one-shot bound; refund
  semantics; spool reset clears `event_spool_complete` and `event_bytes`;
  `get_replayable_transcript` returns `None` after a reset.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_proxy_errors.py`: restore the classification cases the
  #2336 archive removed, in the new shape.
- [ ] Guard the chain walk against a repeated `response_id`: the spec requires
  failing closed on a broken or cyclic parent chain, and the projection has no
  seen-id set of its own.
- [ ] Fix the chain-order statement everywhere it is repeated: the repository
  returns turns oldest first (`turns.reverse()` before return), and any test
  name or comment saying "oldest last" is wrong even where the code is right.
- [ ] `openspec validate --specs`, `uv run ruff check`,
  `codex review --base origin/main`.
