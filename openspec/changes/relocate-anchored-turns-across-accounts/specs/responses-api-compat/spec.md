## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Relocation eligibility has a single decision point

The decision whether an anchored request may be dispatched to a different account, and which request body that dispatch carries, MUST be produced by one shared, transport-independent evaluation. Every transport — direct HTTP streaming, downstream WebSocket, and the HTTP session bridge — MUST obtain its verdict from that evaluation rather than computing its own eligibility. Given equal inputs, all transports MUST reach the same verdict.

The evaluation MUST be pure with respect to the request: loading the durable transcript is the only I/O, it MUST happen in one place, and a failure to load it MUST be treated as "no transcript" rather than as an error that fails the request.

Every verdict MUST record a closed-vocabulary decline reason, and a declined relocation MUST leave the request on exactly the behaviour it has today.

The verdict MUST decline, before consulting any evidence, when downstream-visible output has already been emitted, or when the request is bound to its account by the `single_account` routing strategy, an input-file pin, turn-state ownership, or a session-identity binding. These are ownership facts that no request body can neutralize.

#### Scenario: Transports agree

- **GIVEN** identical request state, anchor, evidence and durable transcript
- **WHEN** the stream path, the WebSocket path and the bridge path each evaluate relocation
- **THEN** all three produce the same verdict, the same body and the same decline reason

#### Scenario: File-pinned and turn-state-owned requests never relocate

- **GIVEN** a request carrying an input-file account pin or a turn-state owner
- **WHEN** relocation is evaluated after a definitive pre-dispatch rejection
- **THEN** the verdict declines with an ownership reason
- **AND** the request keeps today's owner-bound behaviour

#### Scenario: Visible output ends eligibility

- **GIVEN** the client has already received response output for this turn
- **WHEN** the upstream connection then fails
- **THEN** relocation declines
- **AND** the failure is surfaced as it is today

### Requirement: Anchored turns relocate on a rebuilt durable transcript

When an anchored continuation cannot be served by its owner account and the evidence is definitive — an upstream quota or usage-limit rejection, or a confirmed pre-dispatch transport failure, in both cases with no response event emitted and no downstream-visible output — the proxy MUST attempt to rebuild the turn's full conversation from the durable operation spool and dispatch it to another account without the anchor.

The rebuild MUST walk the `parent_response_id` chain from the anchor and assemble the turns oldest first, matching the order the durable repository returns them in, and for each turn MUST combine the stored request body with the stored terminal response output. A rebuild that assembles the chain in any other order MUST be rejected: a chronologically reversed conversation satisfies every structural predicate and fails silently. It MUST be bounded by a maximum turn count, by a maximum byte size measured across the whole transcript rather than per turn, and by a maximum **item** count. Turns and bytes do not bound items — the smallest legal item repeated until the byte budget is spent yields six figures of them — and the item count is what every per-item cost in the rebuild scales with.

A turn counts as settled, and so as material for the rebuild, only when its spool carries a terminal event that reports an answer. A terminal event that reports a failure MUST NOT make a failed turn read as an answered one in the rebuilt conversation. The rebuilt input MUST then be joined to the client's current turn. The join MUST NOT delete, reorder or alter any item the client sent. A rebuild that drops a client item because its content coincides with an item already in the chain is a worse failure than refusing to rebuild at all: the user's message is gone, the result still satisfies every structural predicate, and nothing downstream can detect it.

**The client's items are inviolable; the chain's are not.** That asymmetry decides the join, and it is the only thing that needs to.

The chain is the proxy's own reconstruction of turns the client is not currently sending. The client's input is what the client is sending right now. When the two overlap, the client's copy is authoritative — so the proxy MUST drop the overlapping portion **from the chain** and MUST keep every item the client sent. Dropping a chain turn the client has just re-supplied loses nothing; dropping a client item loses something no downstream check can detect.

The join is therefore: walk the chain oldest first; where the client's input matches the **tail** of what the walk has accumulated, discard that tail; append the client's input verbatim and last. The overlap MUST be anchored at the accumulated tail — a match anywhere else is a coincidence, not a restatement, and MUST NOT shorten anything.

**The comparison MUST be made on the projected form of both sides, and the dispatched items MUST be the client's verbatim ones.** The key the comparison uses MUST be built from a **positive enumeration of the fields that identify an item** — a message's role and content, a tool call's identity and arguments, a tool output's call and result — and MUST NOT be built by subtracting a list of fields that do not identify one. A subtractive list is open-ended: every field the wire may carry and the recording may drop has to be remembered, and the two rounds that tried it were each defeated by a field nobody had listed yet. A positive list is bounded by what a turn *is*, and a field nobody thought of is ignored by default instead of doubling the conversation.

**The enumeration MUST go all the way down.** It applies to every nested structure the key reaches — a content part, a tool declaration, a tool call's arguments — and not only to an item's top level. Serializing a nested value whole makes every field inside it identity-bearing, which is the subtractive failure again one level lower: a client that rewords a tool's description between turns then reads as a different turn and has its conversation dispatched twice. A structure the enumeration does not reach MUST make the item unidentifiable rather than compared on its raw form, so the rebuild fails closed instead of guessing.

The enumeration MUST also be checked against the set of item kinds the strict predicate admits, so a kind added later is identified rather than silently compared by accident. The chain's items have been through the account-neutral projection and the client's have not, so comparing them as they stand makes the overlap depend on fields the projection normalizes away: one legal difference — an assistant message that omits `status`, which the wire allows — collapses the overlap to zero and doubles the whole conversation. Normalize for the comparison only. Never let normalization reach the body that is dispatched.

**The overlap computation MUST be linear in the number of items.** The transcript caps bound turns and bytes, not items, so a chain that is legal under both can still carry six figures of them; a nested scan over that is minutes of blocking work on a single-worker event loop, inside a failover path whose whole purpose is to be faster than losing the conversation. Apply the same rule to each chain turn's stored request as the walk accumulates it, so a parent turn that restated the conversation replaces what it restates instead of repeating it.

The proxy MUST NOT attempt to classify the client's intent. Whether the input is a full resend, a continuation delta, a rolling window of recent turns, or a coincidence is not knowable from the request: a client that re-sends its last exchange plus a new turn is byte-identical to one whose conversation genuinely began at that exchange. Any rule that decides between them — from `previous_response_id`, from the presence of model-authored items, from structural self-containment — will be wrong for one of them. The tail-overlap rule needs no such decision, because both readings produce the same correct conversation.

**A request that names a prior response is owed material.** When it names one and the chain is absent, incomplete or unusable, the proxy MUST fail closed; it MUST NOT dispatch the client's own input as though it were the whole conversation, because the original dispatch would have carried prior state the relocated one would not. A request naming no prior response is owed nothing, and its own body is the conversation. This is the one place the anchor is read, and it decides whether material is owed — never what the input contains.

`responses_input_items_are_self_contained_fresh_replay` MUST NOT be read as "this input carries the whole conversation". It answers a different question — whether the input references state the proxy does not hold — and using it as a completeness test inverts the outcome for the shapes Codex actually sends.

#### Scenario: A delta continuation survives its exhausted owner

- **GIVEN** a continuation carrying only `previous_response_id` and one new user turn
- **AND** the owner account answers with a usage-limit rejection before any response event
- **AND** the durable chain for that anchor is complete
- **WHEN** relocation is evaluated
- **THEN** the proxy rebuilds the conversation from the spool, drops the anchor, and dispatches to another account
- **AND** the client receives the response rather than an owner-unavailable failure

#### Scenario: A client full resend is not doubled

- **GIVEN** the client's input restates the whole conversation the chain reconstructs
- **WHEN** the join runs
- **THEN** the overlapping chain tail is discarded and the client's body is dispatched
- **AND** no turn appears twice

#### Scenario: A rolling window keeps everything

- **GIVEN** a four-turn chain and a client that sends the last exchange plus a new turn
- **WHEN** the join runs
- **THEN** the three earlier turns survive from the chain, the restated exchange survives from the client, and the new turn is last
- **AND** no item the client sent is missing

#### Scenario: A legal field difference does not double the conversation

- **GIVEN** a client restating the chain's turns in a form the wire allows but the projection normalizes — an assistant message without `status`, say
- **WHEN** the join computes the overlap
- **THEN** the restated turns are recognised and the chain's copies are discarded
- **AND** the dispatched body carries the client's items as the client sent them

#### Scenario: A coincidental content match never costs the client a message

- **GIVEN** a client turn whose first item is byte-identical to an item in the middle of the chain, while being new content
- **WHEN** the join runs
- **THEN** nothing is discarded, because the match is not at the accumulated tail
- **AND** every item the client sent is dispatched

#### Scenario: A chain turn that restated the conversation replaces what it restates

- **GIVEN** a chain whose later turn stored a request repeating earlier turns
- **WHEN** the walk accumulates it
- **THEN** the repeated tail is replaced rather than appended
- **AND** the rebuilt conversation contains no turn twice

#### Scenario: An unlisted wire field does not double the conversation

- **GIVEN** a client restating the chain's turns with any field the wire permits and the recording does not keep — one the implementation has never enumerated
- **WHEN** the join computes the overlap
- **THEN** the restated turns are still recognised, because the key is built from what identifies a turn rather than from what to ignore
- **AND** this holds for a field nested inside a content part or a tool declaration exactly as it holds at the item's top level

#### Scenario: Rewording a tool description does not resend the conversation

- **GIVEN** a client whose tool declarations carry a different description, format or search configuration than the recording kept, while declaring the same tools
- **WHEN** the join computes the overlap
- **THEN** the turns are recognised as restatements and the conversation is dispatched once

#### Scenario: The item count is bounded

- **GIVEN** a chain within the turn and byte bounds whose turns carry very many small items
- **WHEN** the rebuild walks it
- **THEN** it refuses once the item bound is passed, rather than doing unbounded per-item work

#### Scenario: The byte bound is a whole-transcript bound

- **GIVEN** a chain whose turns are individually within the byte bound but whose total exceeds it
- **WHEN** the rebuild walks the chain
- **THEN** it refuses, rather than admitting every turn because each one fits

#### Scenario: A failed turn is not rebuilt as an answered one

- **GIVEN** a turn whose spool ends in a terminal event reporting failure rather than an answer
- **WHEN** the rebuild reaches that turn
- **THEN** it is not treated as settled material
- **AND** the rebuild fails closed rather than presenting the failure as the assistant's answer

#### Scenario: An incomplete spool fails closed

- **GIVEN** a turn in the parent chain whose event spool is marked incomplete, or whose stored request body is missing
- **WHEN** relocation is evaluated
- **THEN** no rebuilt body is produced
- **AND** the request keeps today's owner-unavailable behaviour

#### Scenario: Unsettled tool state fails closed

- **GIVEN** a rebuilt body whose final turn contains a tool call with no matching output
- **WHEN** the strict account-neutral predicate runs
- **THEN** the rebuild is rejected and the request stays owner-bound

#### Scenario: A transport without durable material keeps failing closed

- **GIVEN** an anchored turn on a transport that records no durable operation material for its parent turns
- **WHEN** its owner account answers with a definitive quota rejection
- **THEN** no rebuild is attempted and the request keeps today's owner-unavailable behaviour
- **AND** the outcome is reported as an absent transcript, not as a failed rebuild

#### Scenario: A deterministic non-quota rejection is not relocated

- **GIVEN** the owner answers with an invalid-request rejection
- **WHEN** relocation is evaluated
- **THEN** the rejection is surfaced
- **AND** no other account is attempted, because another account would reject it identically

### Requirement: Ambiguous eventless dispatches relocate once behind the durable fence

When a dispatch left for upstream and the transport then failed ambiguously — `stream_incomplete`, `stream_idle_timeout`, or `upstream_request_timeout` — the proxy MAY relocate the turn to another account exactly once, and MUST do so only through the atomic one-shot claim defined by "Fenced one-shot recovery dispatch".

Beyond that claim, the proxy MUST require all of the following before relocating, and MUST fail closed when any is absent:

- no downstream-visible output, no recorded response id, and zero spooled events for the operation — a single spooled event is proof that upstream executed the turn, which makes the outcome known rather than ambiguous;
- the elapsed time since dispatch is within a bounded ambiguity window, so a turn that may be mid-execution and about to write its first event is not duplicated;
- the relocated dispatch carries the origin operation's side-effect replay-dedupe identity, so a tool call the original dispatch may already have produced is suppressed on the new account rather than executed a second time. A transport that does not implement that dedupe contract MUST NOT take the fenced lane at all: without it the duplicate this lane knowingly risks is unbounded in kind, not just in tokens. Today only the HTTP session bridge implements it;
- the rebuilt body satisfies the same strict account-neutral predicate required by "Anchored turns relocate on a rebuilt durable transcript".

The one-shot budget MUST be at most one dispatch per operation for the whole of that operation's retention, across every replica and every reconnect. When the claim is refused, the request MUST terminate through the fail-closed outcome its transport already produces today and MUST NOT invent a second dispatch: on the HTTP session bridge that is the `upstream_operation_status_unknown` rejection with its cooldown retry hint; on the direct streaming and WebSocket paths it is the terminal transport failure the client receives today. A refused claim MUST NOT be reported as a pool-exhaustion or usage-limit outcome.

#### Scenario: One ambiguous failure buys one relocation

- **GIVEN** an eventless operation whose transport failed with `stream_incomplete`
- **WHEN** relocation is evaluated and the claim succeeds
- **THEN** the turn is dispatched once on another account
- **AND** a second ambiguous failure for the same operation is refused and terminates through its transport's existing fail-closed outcome without a second dispatch

#### Scenario: A spooled event proves execution and blocks relocation

- **GIVEN** an operation with at least one spooled response event
- **WHEN** the transport fails ambiguously
- **THEN** relocation declines without consuming the claim
- **AND** the request terminates as it does today

#### Scenario: A stale ambiguity is not relocated

- **GIVEN** an eventless ambiguous operation whose dispatch is older than the ambiguity window
- **WHEN** relocation is evaluated
- **THEN** relocation declines
- **AND** the claim is not consumed

#### Scenario: Duplicate side effects are suppressed, not executed

- **GIVEN** a relocated ambiguous dispatch that reproduces a side-effecting tool call the origin dispatch may already have emitted
- **WHEN** the replacement account emits that call
- **THEN** the existing side-effect replay dedupe suppresses it
- **AND** the suppression uses the dedicated terminal failure rather than executing the call twice

### Requirement: A relocation dispatch starts from a fresh spool

Before a relocated dispatch is sent, the proxy MUST clear any partial event spool recorded for that operation, so a transcript rebuilt later cannot concatenate the abandoned attempt's events onto the replacement's. The clear MUST happen in the same atomic step that consumes the replay claim.

#### Scenario: A partial spool cannot leak into the replacement

- **GIVEN** an operation that spooled a partial, non-terminal event stream before its ambiguous failure
- **WHEN** the relocation claim is consumed
- **THEN** the operation's spool is empty before the replacement frame is sent
- **AND** a later transcript rebuild sees only the replacement's events

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Durable replay is limited to ambiguous transport outcomes

The proxy MUST consume an `unknown` recovery-journal record for a fresh
account-neutral replay only after an ambiguous transport outcome, represented
by `stream_incomplete`, `stream_idle_timeout`, or
`upstream_request_timeout`, and only before any response event or downstream
output.

An explicit deterministic `response.failed` error MUST settle normally and MUST NOT consume the recovery fence. A deterministic rejection that proves upstream accepted nothing — an upstream quota or usage-limit rejection with no response event and no downstream-visible output — MAY instead relocate through the unfenced lane defined by "Anchored turns relocate on a rebuilt durable transcript", which consumes no replay budget and is rolled back rather than claimed. Every other deterministic rejection, including an invalid-request rejection, MUST NOT be relocated to another account at all.

#### Scenario: Transport ambiguity permits one replay

- **GIVEN** an `unknown` proof-gated journal record exists
- **AND** the upstream closes or times out before any response event
- **WHEN** the bridge handles the ambiguous transport failure
- **THEN** the record is atomically claimed and the request is replayed once
  on a fresh account-neutral upstream session

#### Scenario: Deterministic failure is not replayed

- **GIVEN** an `unknown` proof-gated journal record exists
- **AND** upstream emits an explicit pre-output `response.failed` such as an
  invalid request rejection
- **WHEN** the bridge handles that terminal event
- **THEN** it forwards the terminal failure
- **AND** it leaves the journal available for settlement without replaying on
  another account

#### Scenario: A deterministic quota rejection takes the unfenced lane

- **GIVEN** an anchored turn whose owner answers with a pre-output quota or usage-limit rejection
- **WHEN** the proxy evaluates relocation
- **THEN** the recovery claim is not consumed
- **AND** relocation, if the strict rebuild succeeds, proceeds on the unfenced lane
- **AND** a failure to rebuild leaves the journal available for settlement

### Requirement: Fenced one-shot recovery dispatch

The durable recovery journal MUST persist a one-shot replay budget for every
recovery-safe request. The budget MUST be at most one dispatch per operation for the whole of that operation's retention, across every replica and every reconnect. The budget MUST be consumed atomically when a replay is
claimed for dispatch, together with the spool clear required by "A relocation dispatch starts from a fresh spool", and a caller that proves the replay never reached the
upstream send boundary MUST restore that claim under the same session owner
fence. A replacement session MUST retain or transfer a fenced origin owner
until the claim is rolled back or settled; selecting a replacement or failing
preflight MUST NOT permanently consume an unsent replay.

The claim MUST be refused unless the preconditions in "Ambiguous eventless dispatches relocate once behind the durable fence" hold. A refused claim MUST terminate the request through the fail-closed outcome its transport already produces, without a second dispatch.

#### Scenario: Concurrent reconnects consume one replay

- **WHEN** concurrent reconnects observe the same ambiguous operation
- **THEN** exactly one owner atomically claims the persisted replay budget and
  other reconnects fail closed without dispatching a duplicate

#### Scenario: Pre-dispatch replacement failure restores the budget

- **WHEN** a replay claim is made but replacement admission or preflight fails
  before the exact upstream frame is sent
- **THEN** the claim returns to the available state and the fenced origin
  owner is released only after that rollback succeeds

#### Scenario: Successful replacement settles the origin journal

- **WHEN** a replacement session dispatches the claimed replay and receives a
  terminal response event
- **THEN** settlement uses the retained origin owner fence before releasing it
  and the replay budget cannot be claimed again

#### Scenario: A restored claim is reusable exactly once

- **WHEN** a claim is restored after a pre-dispatch preflight failure
- **THEN** a later ambiguous failure for the same operation may claim it again
- **AND** after that dispatch the budget is exhausted
